# üèóÔ∏è Architectural Decomposition Planning Task

## Task Context
**Date Started:** January 14, 2025  
**Branch:** `feature/deep-work-ui-improvements`  
**Status:** Planning Phase  
**Goal:** Plan safe decomposition of monolithic core components

## Problem Statement
User identified that these 5 critical files are too risky to modify:
1. `AdminLifeLock.tsx` - Central coordinator (doing too much)
2. `TabLayoutWrapper.tsx` - Navigation logic (monolithic) 
3. `tab-config.ts` - Tab definitions (single config file)
4. `TaskContainer.tsx` - Smart container (all task logic)
5. `supabaseTaskService.ts` - Database operations (giant service)

## Current State Analysis
- ‚úÖ Deep Work page import errors fixed
- ‚úÖ Application running stable on feature branch
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive architectural analysis completed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Core components identified as too monolithic for safe modification

## Decomposition Strategy Overview
Break down each monolithic component into smaller, focused, testable pieces using:
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Custom Hooks Pattern
- Provider Pattern  
- Configuration Registry
- Service Layer Decomposition

## Next Steps Planned
1. **Planning Phase** (Current)
   - Document detailed decomposition plans for each component
   - Identify migration strategies and safety protocols
   - Create implementation roadmap

2. **Prototype Phase**
   - Extract one hook/component as proof of concept
   - Test thoroughly to ensure no regressions
   - Validate approach before proceeding

3. **Implementation Phase** 
   - Incremental decomposition following proven patterns
   - Maintain backward compatibility throughout
   - Comprehensive testing at each step

- `TASK-OVERVIEW.md` - This summary
- `architectural-analysis.md` - Full architectural insights
- `decomposition-plans/` - Detailed plans for each component
- `implementation-notes/` - Progress tracking and lessons learned

## Safety Protocol
- Never break working functionality
- One small change at a time
- Test immediately after each change
- Keep rollback strategies ready
- Maintain feature branch isolation
