# `.skills/` (Black Box skills)

This folder contains **skill files**: small, reusable frameworks the AI can follow to do work consistently.

Each skill is a single `.md` file that defines:
- **When to use it** (trigger)
- **Inputs to collect** (what the AI needs)
- **Artifacts to create** (plans, notes, outputs)
- **A step-by-step process** (with checklists)
- **How to track progress** (ticking off steps as work completes)

Naming:
- Use kebab-case: `deep-research.md`, `ui-triage.md`, `copy-review.md`, etc.

Common skills here:
- `feedback-triage.md`
- `repo-codebase-navigation.md`
- `supabase-ddl-rls.md`
- `testing-playbook.md`
