# üéØ BMAD PLAN: Component Consolidation Strategy

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Status:** Pre-Execution Planning  
**Git Backup:** Commit `317dab0` - emergency-directory-restructure branch

---

## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Problem:** AI editing confusion due to 400+ duplicate task components across multiple directory structures.  
**Root Cause:** 5 copies of core components (SisoDeepFocusPlan, UnifiedTaskCard, etc.) in different locations.  
**Solution:** Surgical component consolidation while preserving excellent LifeLock domain architecture.  
**Risk Level:** Medium (with proper backup and rollback strategy)

---

## üìä ANALYSIS FINDINGS

### ‚úÖ **What's Working Well (PRESERVE)**
- **LifeLock Domain Architecture**: Excellent workflow-based organization
- **Configuration-Driven Rendering**: Smart ENHANCED_TAB_CONFIG system  
- **Hybrid Architecture**: UI in `/features/`, domain logic in `/ecosystem/`
- **Component Documentation**: Well-documented architecture in LIFELOCK-COMPONENT-ARCHITECTURE.md

### üö® **Critical Issues (FIX)**
- **5 copies** of `SisoDeepFocusPlan` across different directories
- **3 copies** of `UnifiedTaskCard` (identical files)
- **6+ copies** of core task managers and UI components
- **Cross-directory import confusion** causing AI to edit wrong files

### üéØ **Target Outcome**
- **Single source of truth** for each component
- **Preserve LifeLock workflow structure** exactly as designed
- **Fix AI editing confusion** by eliminating duplicate targets
- **Maintain functionality** with zero breaking changes

**Current State:**
```
src/shared/ui/siso-deep-focus-plan.tsx                 ‚Üê ACTIVE (used by LifeLock)
src/components/ui/siso-deep-focus-plan.tsx            ‚Üê DELETE  
src/components/ui/siso-deep-focus-plan-v2.tsx         ‚Üê DELETE
src/components/layout/siso-deep-focus-plan.tsx        ‚Üê DELETE
src/components/layout/siso-deep-focus-plan-v2.tsx     ‚Üê DELETE
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Verify `/shared/ui/` version is the active one used by LifeLock
- [ ] Update all imports to point to canonical path
- [ ] Delete duplicate files
- [ ] Test all LifeLock workflows still work

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Only 1 copy of SisoDeepFocusPlan exists
- ‚úÖ All LifeLock tabs (morning, light work, deep work, etc.) work perfectly
- ‚úÖ AI edits the correct file when asked to modify deep focus work

#### **Story 2.2: UnifiedTaskCard Consolidation**
**Goal:** Eliminate 2 duplicate copies of UnifiedTaskCard  
**Current State:**
```
src/features/tasks/components/UnifiedTaskCard.tsx     ‚Üê ACTIVE (used by TasksPage)
src/components/layout/UnifiedTaskCard.tsx            ‚Üê DELETE (duplicate)
src/components/working-ui/UnifiedTaskCard.tsx        ‚Üê DELETE (duplicate)
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Verify `/features/tasks/components/` version is actively used
- [ ] Update any imports pointing to layout/working-ui versions
- [ ] Delete duplicate files  
- [ ] Test task management functionality

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Only 1 copy of UnifiedTaskCard exists
- ‚úÖ All task functionality works (AdminTasks page, etc.)
- ‚úÖ AI edits correct file when asked to modify task cards

#### **Story 2.3: Task Manager Consolidation**
**Goal:** Consolidate 6+ TaskManager copies into logical locations  

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Map all TaskManager file locations and usage
- [ ] Choose canonical location based on actual usage
- [ ] Update imports and delete duplicates
- [ ] Verify task management workflows

### **PHASE 3: DIRECTORY CLEANUP (Day 2-3)**

#### **Story 3.1: /components/layout/ and /components/working-ui/ Analysis**
**Goal:** Determine if these directories contain dead code  

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Verify no active imports from these directories
- [ ] Move any truly used components to appropriate locations
- [ ] Delete confirmed duplicate/unused files
- [ ] Clean up empty directories

#### **Story 3.2: LifeLock Architecture Enhancement (OPTIONAL)**
**Goal:** Implement your suggested page-based organization  
**Current:**
```
src/ecosystem/internal/lifelock/sections/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MorningRoutineSection.tsx
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LightFocusWorkSection.tsx
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DeepFocusWorkSection.tsx

```
src/ecosystem/internal/lifelock/pages/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ morning-routine/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MorningRoutineSection.tsx
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ components/

## üö® RISK MITIGATION

### **High Risk Items:**
1. **SisoDeepFocusPlan** - Core component used by all LifeLock workflows
2. **TasksPage imports** - Active route from AdminTasks
3. **Cross-directory dependencies** - Complex import chains

### **Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Test after each file deletion** - Never delete multiple files at once
2. **Keep backup branch** - emergency-directory-restructure with current state
3. **Incremental approach** - One component type at a time
4. **Automated verification** - Script to test all LifeLock workflows

### **Abort Criteria:**
- Any LifeLock workflow stops working
- AdminTasks page fails to load
- More than 2 components break simultaneously

## üìã SUCCESS METRICS

### **Immediate Success (Phase 1-2):**
- [ ] **Reduced duplicate count**: 400+ files ‚Üí <150 files (60% reduction)
- [ ] **AI editing accuracy**: AI edits correct component 100% of time
- [ ] **Zero functional regression**: All workflows work perfectly

### **Long-term Success (Phase 3-4):**
- [ ] **Clear component boundaries**: Each component has single location
- [ ] **Maintainable architecture**: Easy to add new LifeLock workflows
- [ ] **Developer experience**: AI and humans can navigate codebase easily
