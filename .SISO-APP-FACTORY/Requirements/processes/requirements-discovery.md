# Requirements Discovery Process

**A systematic approach to gathering, analyzing, and documenting product requirements.**

---

## üéØ **Discovery Overview**

### Purpose
Transform stakeholder needs, user problems, and business objectives into clear, actionable product requirements.

### Discovery Timeline
**Total Duration:** 2-3 weeks  
**Effort:** 40-60% of PRD development time  
**Key Principle:** Invest time upfront to save months later  

---

## üìã **Pre-Discovery Preparation**

### 1. Stakeholder Identification (Day 1)
Create a comprehensive stakeholder map:

| Stakeholder Type | Examples | Information Needed | Interview Priority |
|-----------------|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Primary Users** | End users, customers | Pain points, workflows, goals | High |
| **Business Stakeholders** | Product owners, executives | Business objectives, constraints | High |
| **Technical Team** | Developers, architects | Technical constraints, capabilities | High |
| **Secondary Users** | Admins, support team | Edge cases, operational needs | Medium |
| **External Partners** | Vendors, integrators | Integration requirements | Medium |

### 2. Research Foundation (Days 1-2)
**Existing Knowledge Audit:**
- [ ] Previous user research and feedback
- [ ] Support tickets and common issues
- [ ] Analytics data and usage patterns
- [ ] Competitive analysis and market research
- [ ] Technical debt and system constraints

**Research Questions Framework:**
- **What** are users trying to accomplish?
- **Why** is this important to them/business?
- **How** do they currently solve this problem?
- **When** and **where** does this problem occur?
- **Who** else is affected by this problem?

**For Business Stakeholders:**
- "What business objective is driving this project?"
- "How does this align with broader company goals?"
- "What does success look like for this initiative?"

#### Problem Deep Dive (20 minutes)
**Universal Questions:**
- "Describe the biggest challenges you face with [problem area]"

- "If you could wave a magic wand, what would the ideal solution look like?"

**Follow-up Probes:**
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "How often does this happen?"
- "What's the impact when this goes wrong?"
- "Who else is affected by this?"

#### Solution Exploration (15 minutes)
- "What solutions have you tried before?"
- "What worked well? What didn't?"
- "What would make the biggest difference in your work?"

#### Constraints & Priorities (10 minutes)
- "What are the non-negotiable requirements?"
- "What would be nice to have but not essential?"
- "What are the biggest risks or concerns?"
- "What timeline constraints should we consider?"

#### Closing (5 minutes)
- "Is there anything important we haven't discussed?"
- "Who else should we talk to about this?"
- "Would you be available for follow-up questions?"
- "Can we schedule a time to review our findings with you?"

### Interview Best Practices
‚úÖ **Do:**
- Ask open-ended questions
- Listen more than you talk
- Probe for specific examples
- Stay curious and avoid leading questions
- Document exact quotes for powerful insights

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Propose solutions during discovery
- Interrupt or rush responses
- Make assumptions about user knowledge
- Skip the emotional aspects of problems
- Promise features or timelines

- Performance metrics and error rates
- Support ticket volume and categories
- A/B test results and user feedback scores

**Surveys & Questionnaires:**
- Broader user base validation of interview insights
- Quantify problem severity and frequency
- Prioritize feature requests and pain points
- Gather demographic and usage pattern data

### Qualitative Research (Days 6-8)
**User Observation:**
- Shadow users in their natural environment
- Document current workflows and pain points
- Identify unstated needs and assumptions
- Observe workarounds and creative solutions

**Competitive Analysis:**
- How do competitors solve similar problems?
- What are the strengths/weaknesses of existing solutions?
- Where are the opportunities for differentiation?
- What can we learn from their user feedback?

#### Workshop Agenda:

**1. Insights Sharing (60 minutes)**
- Present key findings from interviews and research
- Identify themes and patterns across stakeholders
- Discuss surprises and conflicting viewpoints
- Validate insights with stakeholders present

**2. Problem Definition (45 minutes)**
- Create problem statements using "How Might We" format
- Prioritize problems by impact and frequency
- Ensure alignment on root causes vs. symptoms
- Document problem statements for PRD

**3. Solution Brainstorming (60 minutes)**
- Generate multiple solution approaches
- Consider technical feasibility and constraints
- Evaluate solutions against user needs and business goals
- Identify dependencies and integration points
