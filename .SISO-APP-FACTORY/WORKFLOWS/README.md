cp -r WORKFLOWS/git-workflows/github-flow/ ./.github/
cp WORKFLOWS/git-workflows/feature-branch/.gitmessage ./

# Setup Git hooks
cp WORKFLOWS/git-workflows/hooks/* ./.git/hooks/
chmod +x ./.git/hooks/*
```

### **2. Code Review Templates**
```bash
# Copy PR templates
mkdir -p ./.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/
cp WORKFLOWS/code-review/review-templates/* ./.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/

# Copy issue templates
mkdir -p ./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/

# GitHub Flow Workflow

## Branch Naming Convention
- `feature/TASK-123-short-description`
- `bugfix/TASK-456-fix-description`
- `hotfix/critical-issue-description`
- `docs/update-documentation`

## Workflow Steps
1. **Create Feature Branch**: Branch from `main` for new work
2. **Make Changes**: Commit changes with clear, descriptive messages
3. **Open Pull Request**: Create PR early for collaboration
4. **Code Review**: Ensure all required reviews are completed
5. **Deploy to Staging**: Automatic deployment to staging environment
6. **Merge to Main**: Merge after approval and successful tests
7. **Deploy to Production**: Automatic deployment to production
8. **Delete Branch**: Clean up feature branch after merge

## Commit Message Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
```

#### **Git Commit Template**

# * fix (bug fix)
# * docs (changes to documentation)
# * style (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
# * refactor (refactoring production code)
# * test (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
# * chore (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
#
# Scope is optional and should be the feature/component being changed
#
# Subject should use imperative mood and not end with period
# No more than 50 characters
#
# Body should explain what and why, not how
# Wrap at 72 characters
#
# Footer should contain any BREAKING CHANGES or GitHub issue references
```
