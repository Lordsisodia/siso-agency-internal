- **Priority**: Medium (UX clarity)
- **Status**: Not started

## üö® CRITICAL DATABASE ISSUES

### **Task Persistence Failure**
- **Issue**: User created tasks last night that didn't save

- **Status**: Needs immediate investigation

## üîß MOBILE INTERACTION FAILURES

### **Light Focus Work Section**

## üåê MOBILE VS DESKTOP DISPARITY

### **Interface Behavior Differences**

  - JavaScript event binding issues
  - Touch target size problems
  - Z-index conflicts on mobile

## üìä FEEDBACK ANALYSIS

### **Severity Breakdown**:

### **Categories**:
