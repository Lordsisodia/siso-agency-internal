## 🐛 **Critical Issues to Fix:**

### 1. **Sidebar Navigation Bug** 🚨 HIGH PRIORITY
**Issue**: Burger menu requires multiple clicks to work
**Impact**: Annoying user experience, breaks app flow
**Status**: 🔴 Not Started
**Location**: Sidebar navigation component

### 2. **Task Card Movement Bug** 🚨 HIGH PRIORITY  
**Issue**: Task cards are moving when they shouldn't
**Expected**: Only move when intentionally swiping
**Current**: Cards move unintentionally 
**Impact**: Confusing and frustrating UX
**Status**: 🔴 Not Started
**Location**: Life Lock task cards (morning routine & deep focus)

## ✨ **Feature Improvements:**

### 3. **Morning Routine Task Split** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Current**: "Shower and brush teeth" (combined task)
**Requested**: Split into two separate tasks:
- "Shower" 
- "Brush teeth"
**Reasoning**: More granular tracking, better completion feeling
**Status**: 🔴 Not Started

### 4. **Custom Task Input System** 🟢 LOW PRIORITY (HIGH IMPACT)
**Issue**: Deep focus tasks are "quite useless"
**Requested**: Section above task cards where user can input custom tasks
**Implementation Ideas**:
- Simple text input above existing cards
- Add/remove functionality
- Future: Chat agent integration for task planning & prioritization
**Status**: 🔴 Not Started

## 🎯 **Future Vision (Keep Simple For Now):**

### 5. **AI Chat Agent for Task Planning** 🔮 FUTURE
**Vision**: Chat with AI agent to:
