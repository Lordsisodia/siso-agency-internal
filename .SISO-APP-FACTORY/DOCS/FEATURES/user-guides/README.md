## 🎯 System Overview

### What is SISO Life Levels?

SISO Life Levels transforms your existing XP/gamification system into a **Life Operating System** where digital progress unlocks tangible real-world benefits. Instead of meaningless levels, you progress through meaningful tiers that grant you actual life privileges.

### 🏆 Tier System

| Tier | Levels | Focus | Key Benefits |
|------|--------|-------|--------------|
| 🥉 **Bronze** | 1-10 | Foundation Builder | Basic treats, flexible wake-up times |
| 🥈 **Silver** | 11-25 | Consistency Master | Hobby time, coffee shop sessions |
| 🥇 **Gold** | 26-50 | Peak Performer | Premium subscriptions, office upgrades |
| 💎 **Platinum** | 51-100 | Life Optimizer | Education investments, sabbatical planning |
| 👑 **Legend** | 101-200 | Reality Architect | Career pivots, major investments |
| 🌟 **Transcendent** | 201+ | System Transcendent | Complete autonomy, unlimited development |

### 🚀 Quick Start

1. **For Users**: Start with [Getting Started Guide](user-guide/getting-started.md)
2. **For Developers**: Begin with [Implementation Guide](technical/implementation-guide.md)
3. **For Project Managers**: Review [Development Roadmap](planning/development-roadmap.md)

## 💡 Core Principles

### 1. **Real-World Impact**
