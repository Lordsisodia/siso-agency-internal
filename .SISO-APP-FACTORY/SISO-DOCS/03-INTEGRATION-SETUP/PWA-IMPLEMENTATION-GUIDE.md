# PWA Implementation Guide for SISO Agency

## What We've Implemented

1. **Web App Manifest** (`public/manifest.json`)
   - App name and icons
   - Standalone display mode (no browser chrome)
   - Theme color matching SISO brand (#FF6B00)
   - App shortcuts for quick access to Dashboard and Tasks

2. **PWA Meta Tags** (in `index.html`)
   - Apple-specific tags for iOS support
   - Theme color for browser UI
   - Mobile web app capability flags

3. **Service Worker** (`public/sw.js`)
   - Offline caching for core assets
   - Background sync capability
   - Update detection

4. **Icon Generation Script** (`generate-pwa-icons.js`)
   - Creates all required icon sizes from your logo

## Setup Instructions

1. **Generate Icons**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/shaansisodia/Desktop/Cursor/SISO_ECOSYSTEM/SISO-CORE
   npm install sharp
   node generate-pwa-icons.js
   ```

2. **Build and Deploy**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview  # Test locally
   ```

## Testing on iPhone

1. **Deploy to a HTTPS URL** (required for PWA):
   - Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or your hosting provider
   - PWAs require HTTPS (except localhost for testing)

2. **Add to Home Screen on iPhone**:
   - Open Safari on iPhone
   - Navigate to your deployed app
   - Tap the Share button (square with arrow)
   - Scroll down and tap "Add to Home Screen"
   - Give it a name and tap "Add"

3. **Verify Full-Screen Experience**:
   - Open the app from home screen
   - Should launch without Safari UI
   - Status bar should be translucent black
   - App should feel native

## Features You'll Get

- **Offline Support**: Basic pages cached for offline viewing
- **App-like Experience**: No browser chrome when launched from home screen
- **Fast Loading**: Service worker caches assets
- **Install Prompts**: Chrome will show "Add to Home Screen" prompts
- **Push Notifications**: Ready for implementation (requires additional setup)

## Next Steps

1. **Test Offline Mode**:
   - Load the app
   - Turn on airplane mode
   - App should still load cached content

2. **Customize Icons**:
   - Replace generated icons with custom designs if needed
   - Ensure icons have proper padding for iOS masks

3. **Enhanced Offline Features**:
   - Add offline pages
   - Implement background sync for data
   - Cache API responses

4. **Push Notifications** (optional):
   - Implement push notification service
   - Add notification permissions request
   - Handle notification clicks

## Troubleshooting

- **Not showing as installable**: Ensure HTTPS and valid manifest
- **Icons not showing**: Check icon paths in manifest.json
- **Service worker not registering**: Check browser console for errors
- **iOS specific issues**: Ensure apple-touch-icon is present
