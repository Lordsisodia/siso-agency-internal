# SISO Ecosystem Planning - Thought Dump
**Date:** January 9, 2025
**Session:** Morning Planning & Architecture Discussion

## ðŸ§  Key Ideas & Conclusions

### 1. AI Chat Assistant for Daily Planning
- **Vision**: Personal AI assistant for 23-minute morning routine
- **Modes**: 
  - Chat mode (text conversation)
  - Voice mode (speak & listen)
  - Read-only mode (listens, doesn't respond back)
- **Core Function**: Help plan day, find priorities, understand what's locked in
- **Data Recording**: Save all information as tasks + timebox planning
- **Transcript Saving**: Every conversation saved for reuse & analysis
- **Self-Improvement**: AI analyzes conversations to optimize experience & learn preferences

### 2. SISO Ecosystem Architecture Strategy
- **Goal**: Split into 3 separate applications while maintaining shared codebase
- **Subdomain Structure**:
  - `SISO.agency/internal` - Internal operations
  - `SISO.agency/client` - Client-facing app  
  - `SISO.agency/partnership` - Partnership program
- **Deployment Strategy**: Separate GitHub repos + separate Vercel hosting
- **Benefit**: Bypass Vercel 12k file limit & edge function constraints

### 3. GitHub Organization Structure
- **Option A**: 3 separate repos (internal, client, partnership)
- **Option B**: Monorepo with shared components
- **Main Branch Strategy**: Auto-push to main after testing
- **Integration**: All apps connect to same core system for data sharing

### 4. Task Integration System
- **Cross-Platform**: AI chat works from phone, LifeLock page, internal app
- **Task Creation**: AI can send tasks directly to main system
- **Data Sync**: Seamless integration across all platforms

### 5. Mac Mini Migration
- **Current State**: Client base code on Mac Mini
- **Goal**: Migrate to main ecosystem
- **Challenge**: Lots of existing functionality to preserve
- **Partnership Program**: Some components already built on Mac Mini

### 6. Technical Improvements Needed
- **iPhone Dictation**: Current dictation is poor quality, needs fixing
- **Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing before main branch pushes
- **Edge Functions**: Optimize to stay within Vercel limits

## ðŸŽ¯ Action Items Identified

1. **Create docs folder structure** for ongoing thought dumps
2. **Design ecosystem architecture** (monorepo vs multi-repo decision)
3. **Build AI chat assistant** with voice/text modes
4. **Research Vercel limits** and deployment strategies
5. **Design task integration API** between chat and main system
6. **Plan GitHub organization** for separate hosting
7. **Migrate Mac Mini components** to main ecosystem

## ðŸ’¡ Key Questions to Resolve

- **Architecture**: Monorepo or multi-repo approach?
- **Deployment**: How to handle Vercel limits effectively?
- **Integration**: Best way to sync tasks across all platforms?
- **Migration**: Priority order for Mac Mini components?

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

Need to prioritize which component to build first and establish the foundational architecture before proceeding with implementation.
