# ⚡ SISO Internal: Light Focus Work Integration PRD

**Product Manager**: John (BMAD PM)  
**Project**: SISO Internal - LifeLock Light Focus Work Consolidation & Integration  
**Type**: Brownfield Enhancement PRD  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: September 12, 2025  
**Priority**: HIGH - Version Fragmentation & Integration Required  

---

## 📊 Problem Statement

### Core Problem
**Light Focus Work feature exists in 4+ fragmented versions** but is NOT integrated into the main LifeLock system. Users cannot access this essential productivity feature despite sophisticated implementation existing.

**Current State Issues**:
- **Version Fragmentation**: 4 different implementations (`-v2`, `Advanced`, `Old`, `.backup`)
- **Architecture Isolation**: Components exist in `/ai-first/features/tasks/` but not in core `/lifelock/sections/`
- **Integration Gap**: Feature missing from main LifeLock interface navigation
- **User Impact**: Expected light work functionality unavailable in daily workflow

### Identified Assets (Mary's Analysis)
✅ **`LightFocusWorkSection-v2.tsx`** - Most recent implementation with:
- Clean `UnifiedWorkSection` architecture pattern
- Dedicated `useLightWorkTasksSupabase` hook
- Proper TypeScript interfaces
- Full CRUD operations for tasks and subtasks

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
1. **Feature Consolidation**: Single authoritative Light Focus Work implementation
2. **LifeLock Integration**: Seamless access via main interface
3. **User Adoption**: >70% of daily users engage with Light Focus Work within 1 week
4. **Workflow Continuity**: Smooth transitions between Morning Routine → Light Work → Deep Work

### Technical Metrics
- **Performance**: Feature loads in <2s (matching MorningRoutineSection)
- **Code Cleanliness**: 0 deprecated versions, single source of truth
- **Integration**: Zero navigation/tab errors
- **Database Consistency**: Unified data patterns with other LifeLock features

- **Cross-Feature Flow**: Integration with Deep Focus Work and other LifeLock features

#### FR-3: Enhanced Task Management
**Priority**: P1 - High
- **Task Operations**: Create, edit, complete, delete tasks and subtasks
- **Due Date Management**: Flexible scheduling and deadline tracking
- **Task Migration**: Push tasks between days for workflow flexibility
- **Prioritization**: Task ordering and priority management

#### FR-4: Database & API Optimization
**Priority**: P1 - High
- **Supabase Integration**: Maintain existing `useLightWorkTasksSupabase` hook
- **Data Consistency**: Align with other LifeLock features' database patterns
- **Real-time Sync**: Immediate data persistence and retrieval
- **Performance**: Optimize queries for fast task loading and updates

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Assessment & Consolidation
1. **Version Analysis**: Compare all 4 existing implementations
2. **Feature Audit**: Identify best functionality from each version
3. **Data Model Review**: Ensure database consistency across versions
4. **Dependency Mapping**: Understand current integrations and requirements

### Phase 2: Integration Implementation
1. **Component Migration**: Move `LightFocusWorkSection-v2.tsx` to `/lifelock/sections/`
2. **Architecture Alignment**: Follow MorningRoutineSection integration patterns
3. **Tab Configuration**: Update navigation to point to unified location
4. **UI/UX Consistency**: Implement LifeLock visual standards

### Phase 3: Enhancement & Cleanup
1. **Feature Enhancement**: Incorporate best elements from other versions
2. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure fast loading and smooth interactions
3. **Legacy Removal**: Clean up deprecated versions and unused components
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive integration and functionality testing
