# LifeLock & App Feedback — 2025-11-25

**Date:** 2025-11-25  
**Reporter:** User (mobile, PWA)  
**Scope:** LifeLock daily view plus related app surfaces (XP Store, Tasks, Clients)

## Issues
- [x] **Main tasks not priority-sorted** — Daily LifeLock main task list ignores priority; subtasks already sorted. Expected: main tasks sorted by priority desc (matching deep work subtasks).
- [x] **Bottom nav misaligned on mobile** — Icons visually off-center in the mobile bottom nav.
- [x] **Forced re-login outside LifeLock** — Navigating to XP Store, Tasks, or Clients shows login wall using manual login (not Clerk) and does not connect to user data.
- [x] **Timebox: cannot change slots** — Editing/changing time slots is blocked or ignored.
- [x] **Timebox: remove smart suggestions** — Current suggestions are low quality; user wants them removed/disabled.
- [x] **Push-up tracker not persisting** — Entered reps/sets do not save.
- [x] **Water tracking not persisting** — Entered water intake does not save.
- [x] **Deep work main task “Done” not removing** — Marking a main task as done doesn’t disappear from the deep work view.

## Desired Outcomes
- Main tasks sorted by priority (same logic as subtasks/deep work).
- Bottom nav icons centered on mobile.
- Consistent Clerk auth session across XP Store, Tasks, Clients without extra login.
- Timebox slots editable; smart suggestions removed/hidden.
- Push-up tracker saves and persists entries.
- Water tracker saves and persists entries.

## Notes
- Treat these as P1 usability blockers for daily workflows.
- Validate on mobile first (PWA install) since issues were observed there.
