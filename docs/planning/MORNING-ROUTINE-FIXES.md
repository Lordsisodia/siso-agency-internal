# Morning Routine Page - Task List

## Priority: Easy Wins First

### ðŸŽ¯ Critical Fixes

#### 1. Progress Bar Not Updating
- **Issue**: 0% complete bar in yellow callout box doesn't update when ticking boxes
- **Location**: Top of morning routine page
- **Priority**: HIGH

#### 2. Duplicate Time Display - Clean Up
- **Issue**: Time shown twice (in title AND in gray text)
  - "Get blood flowing" â†’ "five minutes after" + "5 minutes" in gray
  - "Freshen up" â†’ "freshen up in 25 minutes" + "25 minutes" in gray
  - "Power up brain" â†’ "five minutes" + "5 minutes" in gray
  - "Plan day" â†’ duplicate time display
  - "Meditation" â†’ duplicate time display
- **Solution**: Put time in a pill badge, remove from title and gray text
- **Priority**: MEDIUM (Easy Win - Visual Polish)

#### 3. Task Counter Buttons â†’ Progress Bars
- **Issue**: "0 out of 3", "3 out of 3" buttons next to each task are clunky
- **Solution**: Remove buttons, add progress bar at top of each card that fills as tasks complete
- **Priority**: MEDIUM (Easy Win - Better UX)

### ðŸ”§ Section-Specific Fixes

- **Priority**: MEDIUM

#### Freshen Up Section
- **Reorder**: Move this section to be #2 (right after "Wake up")

#### Power Up Brain Section
- **Issue 1**: Remove "pre-workout" (not currently used)
- **Issue 2**: Change water amount to 500ml

- Focus on easy wins first to build momentum
