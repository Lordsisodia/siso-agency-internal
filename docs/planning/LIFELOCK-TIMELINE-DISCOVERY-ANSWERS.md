## üìÖ WEEKLY VIEW - What Actually Matters

### When You'd Look at Weekly View
**Raw Answer:**
- "During the week, end of the week, start of the week to check progress"
- "At the end of the week, at the start of the week, I'll make a week plan and set the main criteria and goals for what I want to do this week"
- "I'll probably have a weekly checkout as well and just analyze how the week went, how can I improve it, and what can I learn for next time"

**Key Insight:**
- **3 distinct use cases:**
  1. **Start of week**: Plan & set goals
  2. **During week**: Check progress
  3. **End of week**: Checkout & analyze

**Design Implication:**
- Need both PLANNING mode and REVIEW mode
- Weekly checkout component (like daily checkout but for week)

---

### #1 Question to Answer
**Raw Answer:**
- "Am I on track? Did I have a good week? Or what should I improve? All of the above, I guess"
- "I can kind of see how the week went, how the week's going, what the overall goals were for the week"
- "How did the week go? Are the weeks getting better? Are the weeks getting worse?"

**Key Insight:**
- Not one question - it's THREE:
  1. Current status: "Am I on track?"
  2. Performance: "Did I have a good week?"
  3. Improvement: "What should I improve?"
  4. PLUS trend: "Am I getting better over time?"

**Design Implication:**
- First page MUST show all three at once
- Need week-over-week trend visualization

---

### Past Weeks Usage
**Raw Answer:**
- "Yeah, I would look at past weeks sometimes"
- "Ideally, I'd just look at the current week, and then maybe I'd plan some stuff ahead of time for the upcoming weeks"
- "Same way on the lifelock, how I can scroll to previous days, scroll to future days, you should be able to also do this on the weekly"

**Key Insight:**
- Mostly current week, but needs ability to scroll back/forward
- Same navigation pattern as daily view

**Design Implication:**
- Top nav: ‚Üê Previous Week | Week of Jan 1-7 | Next Week ‚Üí
- Can scroll infinitely back/forward like daily

---

### 30-Second Glance View
**Raw Answer:**
- "Previous like days throughout the week"
- "Total XP earned"
- "Did I do the morning routine every single day"
- "What time did I wake up"
- "What time did I sleep"
- "How long was I awake"
- "How many hours did I log per day"
- "How many tasks did I complete"

**Key Insight:**
- **Priority data points (in order):**
  1. 7-day overview (visual cards)
  2. Total XP earned
  3. Morning routine completion (Y/N each day)
  4. Wake/sleep times
  5. Hours awake
  6. Hours logged
  7. Tasks completed

**Design Implication:**
- First page = dense dashboard with ALL these metrics
- 7 daily cards with mini-stats per day
- Week summary bar at top

---

### Deep Work vs Light Work Split
**Raw Answer:**
- "Yeah, I kind of do care about the split between deep work and light work because they're different types of tasks"
- "Light work is more about life stuff, and then deep work is more about work stuff and it's higher intensity"
- "Light work is like booking a flight or booking an Airbnb‚Äîsomething that just needs to be done, doesn't necessarily take a lot of time"
- "Deep work would be like creating a website or an app for clients"
- "Total tasks done should split these two up, and even the hours logged on these should split these two up"

**Key Insight:**
- Split IS important
- Different categories:
  - **Light work** = Life admin (flights, Airbnb, quick tasks)
  - **Deep work** = High-intensity work (websites, apps, client work)
- Track BOTH tasks AND hours separately

**Design Implication:**
- Separate boxes for deep work vs light work
- Show both task count AND hours logged for each
- Example:
  - Deep Work: 12 sessions | 18.5 hours
  - Light Work: 28 tasks | 6.2 hours

---

### Time Analysis Page
**Raw Answer:**
- "Time analysis page is quite cool, but I don't know how you would track like social media"
- "I've actually deleted all social media"
- "Maybe just track the stuff you can track, like the amount of time I've slept because you would do that from the nightly checkout to the morning routine"
- "Amounts of hours logged on deep work‚Äîyou would do that because I would select how long I'm spending on a deep work task"
- "Light work and stuff like that"
- "You probably want calorie trackers as well because we've got that new functionality where I can take a photo of food and then it will track the food‚Äîhow many calories"

**Key Insight:**
- NO social media tracking (doesn't use it)
- Only track what CAN be tracked:
  1. Sleep time (checkout ‚Üí morning routine)
  2. Deep work hours (logged manually)
  3. Light work hours (logged manually)
  4. **CALORIE TRACKING** (new photo feature!)

**Design Implication:**
- Time analysis = trackable time only
- Remove "time wasters" section
- ADD calorie tracking visualization
- Show: Sleep | Deep Work | Light Work | Calories

---

### Next Week Focus Areas
**Raw Answer:**
- "Yeah, we could do a next week's focus areas, but that would come into the weekly checkout"
- "Same way on our daily checkout we have kind of like for tomorrow without actually planning tomorrow"

**Key Insight:**
- Next week focus = part of WEEKLY CHECKOUT
- Same pattern as daily checkout ("for tomorrow" section)
- Not a separate page

**Design Implication:**
- Weekly checkout component at end of week
- Includes "For Next Week" section
- Mirrors daily checkout structure

### Motivation (What Makes You Feel Good/Bad)
**Raw Answer:**
- "Not really about XP numbers‚Äîis cool, green check marks is cool, but it's not really about feeling good reviewing your week"

**Raw Answer:**

### Monthly Goals
**Raw Answer:**
