# LifeLock Timeline Views - Deep Analysis & Final Design
*Created: 2025-10-10*

## 🧠 Core Insight: Each Time Scale Serves a Different Purpose

**The fundamental mistake**: Thinking timeline views are just "zoomed out daily views"

**The reality**: Each time scale answers completely different questions and needs its own structure.

```
DAILY (6 pages)   = EXECUTION     → "How do I do today?"
WEEKLY (5 pages)  = PERFORMANCE   → "How well did I execute?"
MONTHLY (5 pages) = PATTERNS      → "What trends emerged?"
YEARLY (5 pages)  = GROWTH        → "Am I improving long-term?"
LIFE (6 pages)    = PURPOSE       → "Why am I doing this?"
```

## 🛠️ Implementation Approach

1. **Start with Weekly** (reuse existing components)
2. **Build Monthly** (enhance existing calendar)
3. **Create Yearly** (new, but simple grid)
4. **Design Life** (most philosophical, needs UX thought)

Each time scale = different perspective on the same life.
Each page = answer to a specific question.
