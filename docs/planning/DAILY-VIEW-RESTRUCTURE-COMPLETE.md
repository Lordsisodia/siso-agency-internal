## 🎯 BENEFITS ACHIEVED

### 1. AI Clarity
```
Before: "Edit water tracker" → Searches 789-line file
After:  "Edit water tracker" → Opens WaterTracker.tsx (54 lines)
```

### 2. Domain Ownership
- ✅ Light work has its OWN SubtaskMetadata (fix priority bug!)
- ✅ Deep work has its OWN CustomCalendar (blue theme!)
- ✅ No fear of breaking other domains

### 3. Independent Evolution
- Light work → GREEN theme
- Deep work → BLUE theme  
- Wellness → Can be different
- Weekly → Will be completely different UI

### 4. Customization Freedom
```
light-work/components/SubtaskMetadata.tsx
└─ Fix priority cut-off bug (only affects light work!)

deep-work/components/CustomCalendar.tsx
└─ Change to blue theme (doesn't affect light work!)
```
