# Checkout Pattern - All Time Scales
*Created: 2025-10-10*

## üéØ Core Pattern: Every Time Scale Has a Checkout Page

## üé® CHECKOUT COMPONENT DESIGN (Shared Pattern)

All checkout components share this UX:

### Visual Style
```tsx
<Card className="bg-purple-900/10 border-purple-700/30">
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle className="flex items-center text-purple-400">
      <Icon className="h-5 w-5 mr-2" />
      [Time Scale] Check-Out
    </CardTitle>

    {/* Progress Bar */}
    <div className="mt-4">
      <div className="flex justify-between text-sm text-purple-300 mb-2">
        <span>Reflection Progress</span>
        <span>{progress}%</span>
      </div>
      <div className="w-full bg-purple-900/30 rounded-full h-2">
        <motion.div
          className="bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-400 to-purple-600 h-2 rounded-full"
          animate={{ width: `${progress}%` }}
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  </CardHeader>

  <CardContent>
    {/* Questions */}
    {/* Forward-looking section */}
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

### Common Elements
1. **Progress bar** - shows % of reflection complete
2. **Purple color scheme** - consistent with nightly checkout
3. **Text areas** - expandable for long answers
4. **Auto-save** - debounced saves to Supabase
5. **"For [Next Period]" section** - always forward-looking
6. **Save button** (optional - auto-saves anyway)

### Icons by Time Scale
- Daily: Moon üåô
- Weekly: Calendar üìÖ
- Monthly: CalendarDays üìÜ
- Yearly: CalendarRange üìä
- Life: Target üéØ

## üîÑ CHECKOUT WORKFLOW

### When Checkouts Appear

**Daily:**
- Available every evening
- Persists for that date
- Can edit past days

**Weekly:**
- Unlocks Sunday evening or Monday morning
- Persists for that week
- Shows "Complete weekly checkout" reminder if not done

**Monthly:**
- Unlocks last day of month or first day of new month
- Persists for that month
- Shows reminder if month ended but checkout not done

**Yearly:**
- Unlocks December 25-31 (year-end window)
- Can also do on January 1-7
- Big reflection, takes time
- Shows reminder throughout December if not complete

**Life:**
- No unlock - always available
- Suggests quarterly (every 3 months)
- Can trigger anytime feeling stuck/lost
- Sets next review date after completion

---

## üéØ PROGRESS TRACKING

Each checkout calculates completion:

```typescript
// Daily (existing pattern)
const fields = [
  'wentWell',      // Has at least one item
  'evenBetterIf',  // Has at least one item
  'dailyAnalysis', // Has text
  'actionItems',   // Has text
  'keyLearnings',  // Has text
  'tomorrowFocus'  // Has text
];

// Weekly
const fields = [
  'whatWorked',     // Has text
  'whatDidntWork',  // Has text
  'whatLearned',    // Has text
  'whatToImprove',  // Has text
  'nextWeekFocus'   // Has at least one item
];

// Monthly
const fields = [
  'whatWorked',
  'whatDidntWork',
  'patternsEmerged',
  'whatToChange',
  'nextMonthGoals'  // Has at least one goal
];

// Yearly
const fields = [
  'biggestWins',
  'biggestChallenges',
  'learnedAboutSelf',
  'patternsOver12Months',
  'doDifferently',
  'mostProudOf',
  'nextYearTheme'
];

// Life
const fields = [
  'alignedWithValues',
  'makingProgress',
  'mostProudOf',
  'wouldRegret',
  'needsToChange',
  'biggestPriority',
  'lifeScorecardComplete' // All 6 scores filled
];

Progress = (completed fields / total fields) √ó 100
```

## üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

### Phase 1: Weekly Checkout
- Most frequently used after daily
- Check 2-3 times per week
- Build first

### Phase 2: Monthly Checkout
- Used once a week to review month
- Needed for month-to-month tracking

### Phase 3: Yearly Checkout
- Used every 2 weeks during year
- Big reflection at year-end

### Phase 4: Life Review
- Periodic, not as urgent
- Build after time-boxed checkouts working
