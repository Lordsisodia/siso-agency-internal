**Total**: 59+ TypeScript files in clean domain structure

## 🎯 WHAT'S ACTUALLY WORKING

### Fully Integrated Sections:
1. ✅ **Morning Routine**: All 6 components extracted AND used
2. ✅ **Health**: Both components extracted AND used  
3. ✅ **Home Workout**: WorkoutItemCard extracted AND used
4. ✅ **Light Work**: LightWorkTaskList renamed and used
5. ✅ **Deep Work**: DeepWorkTaskList renamed and used

### Sections That Work As-Is:
6. ✅ **Timebox**: 1,008 lines, works fine (extraction optional)
7. ✅ **Checkout**: 475 lines, works fine (extraction optional)

**All 6 daily sections functional!**

---

## 📋 COMPONENTS STATUS

### Fully Integrated (Being Used):
- ✅ MorningRoutineSection: 6 components
- ✅ HealthNonNegotiables: 2 components (reused 8x total)
- ✅ HomeWorkout: 1 component
- ✅ LightWork: LightWorkTaskList
- ✅ DeepWork: DeepWorkTaskList

### Created But Not Integrated (Optional):
- ⏸️ BedTimeTracker (checkout already has inline bed time UI)
- ⏸️ ReflectionQuestions (checkout already has inline reflection UI)
- ⏸️ CategoryMapper (timebox already has inline category mapping)

**Decision**: Keep inline versions OR integrate these later (both work)

---

## 🔴 ERRORS ANALYSIS

### Errors From Migration:
**NONE** ✅

All import/export issues fixed:
- Import paths: All absolute ✅
- Export names: DeepWorkTaskList/LightWorkTaskList ✅
- Archived files: Not imported ✅

### Errors NOT From Migration (Existing Bugs):
1. **Database UUID sync**: Existing bug in offlineManager.ts (creates noise)
2. **Nutrition save loop**: Minor issue, doesn't break functionality
3. **PWA warnings**: Normal development warnings

**App works despite these warnings!**

## 🎯 ACHIEVEMENTS

### Code Organization:
- ✅ sections/ folder ELIMINATED
- ✅ 59 files in domain structure
- ✅ 26 files archived (recoverable)
- ✅ Clear folder hierarchy
- ✅ No ghost components causing confusion

### Component Extraction:
- ✅ 11 components extracted and integrated
- ✅ Main files reduced significantly
- ✅ Focused components (50-100 lines each)
- ✅ AI can find components instantly

### Domain Ownership:
- ✅ Light work has own UI stack (customize GREEN!)
- ✅ Deep work has own UI stack (customize BLUE!)
- ✅ Can fix bugs without affecting other domains
- ✅ Independent evolution

### Pattern Proven:
- ✅ Works for simple sections (light/deep work)
- ✅ Works for complex sections (morning routine)
- ✅ Works for medium sections (wellness)
- ✅ Ready for weekly/monthly/yearly views
