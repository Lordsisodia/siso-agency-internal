## 🎯 THE BIG PICTURE

### What This System Is
> **"This life log system is going to be basically tracking the next 10 years of my life"**

This is NOT:
- ❌ A productivity app
- ❌ A habit tracker
- ❌ A to-do list

This IS:
- ✅ A **10-YEAR LIFE SYSTEM**
- ✅ A tool for tracking **PURPOSE** and **LEGACY**
- ✅ A system for building an **EXTRAORDINARY LIFE**

---

## 🏆 THE LIFE BEING BUILT (Actual Goals)

### Family
- **10 sons** (specifically sons, not just kids)
- **Buy an island** for family
- **Retire dad**

### Possessions
- **Lamborghini Centenario** (~$2M supercar, 40 units worldwide)

### Business Impact
- Work with **100,000 - 1,000,000 business owners**
- Build team of **10,000 - 100,000 people**
- SISO ecosystem as vehicle

### Planning Mindset
> **"Of course, I planned 10 years out. What the fuck, who'd you take me for? And it's a real plan. Why would I plan it and it not be a real plan?"**

This is someone who:
- Plans 10 years out with REAL plans (not aspirational)
- Gets offended at suggestion it's not real
- Lives with extreme intentionality
- Thinks BIG (island, 10 sons, 1M business owners)

**Design Implication:** Build for someone playing at the HIGHEST level.

## 📊 TIME SCALE PHILOSOPHY

Each time scale serves a DIFFERENT purpose:

```
DAILY (6 pages)   = EXECUTION     → "What do I do today?"
  ↓
WEEKLY (5 pages)  = PERFORMANCE   → "How well did I execute?"
  ↓
MONTHLY (5 pages) = PATTERNS      → "Am I improving month-over-month?"
  ↓
YEARLY (5 pages)  = GROWTH        → "Am I on track for my annual goals?"
  ↓
LIFE (6 pages)    = PURPOSE       → "Am I building the life I want?"
```

### Weekly Philosophy
- **Review cycle** for execution
- Questions: "Am I on track? Did I have a good week? What should I improve? Are weeks getting better?"
- **3 use cases:**
  1. Start of week: Plan & set goals
  2. During week: Check progress
  3. End of week: Checkout & analyze

### Monthly Philosophy
- **Pattern detection** + **month-over-month tracking**
- Questions: "Am I improving vs last month? Am I hitting yearly goal pace?"
- **Monthly = "Glue layer":**
  - Least important individually
  - But NEEDED to tie weekly ↔ yearly
  - Bridges tactical (weekly) to strategic (yearly)

### Yearly Philosophy
- **Overarching perspective** to "keep on track"
- Questions: "How are quarters going? Is XP/earnings/hours trending up? Am I balanced?"
- Shows: Trends, growth, life balance

### Life Philosophy
- **Purpose & legacy** tracking
- Questions: "Why am I doing this? What am I building? Am I living my values?"
- Shows: Vision, mission, long-term goals, multi-year progress

## 🎯 30-SECOND WEEKLY DASHBOARD (Priority Data)

If you only have 30 seconds, show:

1. **7-day visual overview** (cards/grid)
2. **Total XP earned** (weekly total)
3. **Morning routine completion** (✅✅✅❌✅✅✅ = 6/7)
4. **Wake times** (Mon 6am, Tue 7am, Wed 10am ⚠️...)
5. **Sleep times** (Sun 11pm, Mon 10:30pm, Tue 11:15pm...)
6. **Hours awake** (Mon 17h, Tue 15.5h, Wed 16.5h...)
7. **Hours logged** (Mon 8h, Tue 6.5h, Wed 7h...)
8. **Tasks completed** (Mon 12, Tue 8, Wed 15...)

**All 8 metrics in ONE view** - dense but scannable.

---

## 🔥 MOTIVATION PSYCHOLOGY (CRITICAL)

> **"Not really about feeling good reviewing your week. I want to see missed workouts, low grades. I want to see where I haven't done morning routines where I've woken up at stupid times with no justifications"**

### What This Means

**NOT about:**
- ❌ Feeling good
- ❌ Celebrating wins (primarily)
- ❌ Positive reinforcement only

**IS about:**
- ✅ **Seeing PROBLEMS**
- ✅ **Accountability**
- ✅ **Raw truth**

**Show prominently:**
- ❌ Missed workouts (red highlights)
- 🔴 Low grades (D, F - warnings)
- ⚠️ Skipped morning routines
- 😡 **Late wake times WITH NO JUSTIFICATION** (biggest red flag)

### Wake Time Justification System (NEW FEATURE)

**Requirement:**
- If wake time is later than target, MUST add justification OR it's flagged

**Examples:**
```
✅ Mon 6:30am - On time
✅ Tue 8:00am "Late client call" - Justified
😡 Wed 10:30am NO JUSTIFICATION - PROBLEM!
✅ Thu 7:15am - On time
⚠️ Fri 9:00am "Flight delay" - Justified
```

**Implementation:**
- Wake time tracking with target
- Justification text field
- Auto-flag if late + no justification
- Color coding:
  - Green = on time
  - Yellow = late but justified
  - Red = late with NO justification

---

## 💪 DEEP WORK vs LIGHT WORK (Everywhere)

### Definitions

**Deep Work:**
- "Work stuff" (professional)
- "Higher intensity"
- Examples: Creating website, app for clients
- Characteristics: High cognitive load, requires focus

**Light Work:**
- "Life stuff" (personal admin)
- "Doesn't take a lot of time"
- Examples: Booking flight, Airbnb
- Characteristics: Quick, low cognitive load, "just needs to be done"

### What to Track (BOTH)

For each type, track:
1. **Task count** (how many tasks)
2. **Hours logged** (how long spent)

**Display:**
```
Deep Work:  12 sessions | 18.5 hours
Light Work: 28 tasks | 6.2 hours
```

**Must split:**
- Weekly view: Separate pages or boxes
- Monthly view: Separate tracking
- Yearly view: Separate totals

---

## ⏱️ TIME TRACKING (Only What's Trackable)

### What CAN Be Tracked

1. **Sleep time:**
   - Source: Nightly checkout → morning wake time
   - Example: 11pm → 7am = 8 hours

2. **Deep work hours:**
   - Source: Manual time entry when logging task
   - Example: "Deep work - 2.5 hours"

3. **Light work hours:**
   - Source: Manual time entry
   - Example: "Book flight - 0.5 hours"

4. **Calories:**
   - Source: Photo food tracking (NEW FEATURE!)
   - Automatic calculation from photo

5. **Hours awake:**
   - Source: Calculated (wake time → checkout time)
   - Example: 7am → 11pm = 16 hours

### What CANNOT Be Tracked

1. **Social media:**
   - "I've actually deleted all social media"
   - NO tracking needed

2. **Untracked time:**
   - Don't estimate or guess
   - Only show what's measured

### Time Analysis Page Content

**Include:**
- Sleep: 8h, 7.5h, 7h, 8.5h, 7h, 6.5h, 7h (avg 7.5h)
- Deep work: 3h, 2.5h, 4h, 2h, 3.5h, 0h, 1h (total 16h)
- Light work: 1h, 1.5h, 0.5h, 2h, 1h, 0.5h, 0.5h (total 7h)
- Calories: 2,200, 2,400, 2,100, 2,500, 2,300, 2,800, 2,000 (avg 2,329)
- Hours awake: 17h, 15.5h, 16h, 18h, 16.5h, 14h, 15h (avg 16h)

**Exclude:**
- Social media
- "Time wasters"
- Untracked estimates

---

## 📅 MONTHLY MONTH-OVER-MONTH (PRIMARY FEATURE)

> **"Monthly is more about tracking on a month-to-month basis and am I improving"**

### Key Questions Monthly Answers

1. "Am I logging more hours than the previous month?"
2. "Am I fixing up my sleep routine better?"
3. "Am I working out more?"
4. "Am I putting on more weight?"
5. "Am I eating more calories?"

### What to Show

**Every metric needs month-over-month:**
```
This Month vs Last Month:

Hours Logged:    85h vs 72h  (+18% ↗️)
Sleep Quality:   7.5h vs 7h  (+7% ↗️)
Workouts:        18 vs 14    (+29% ↗️)
Weight Gain:     +0.6kg vs +0.4kg (↗️)
Calories/Day:    2,400 vs 2,200 (+9% ↗️)
Morning Routine: 22/31 vs 18/28 (+11% ↗️)
```

**Not just absolute numbers - COMPARISON is key!**

## 🗓️ EVENT PROPAGATION SYSTEM

> **"If I know I'm catching a flight on a certain day of a month then I'd put that there as well. And that would carry through to the weekly and daily"**

### How It Works

**Add event at monthly level:**
- Click Jan 15 on monthly calendar
- Add event: "Flight to London - 2pm"

**Automatically appears:**
- Weekly view: Week 3 shows "Jan 15: Flight"
- Daily view: Jan 15 shows "2pm - Flight to London"

**Use cases:**
- Flights
- Important meetings
- Deadlines
- Life events
- Anything that needs visibility

**Implementation:**
- Event database table:
  ```sql
  events (
    id
    user_id
    date
    title
    description
    time
    type (flight, meeting, deadline, etc.)
  )
  ```
- Query events by date range
- Display on all time scales

---

## 🎨 ALL VIEWS MOBILE FIRST

> **"Yeah, everything's on the phone, everything's all mobile first"**

**Requirements:**
- Design for iPhone 14 Pro (393×852px)
- Swipeable pages (Framer Motion)
- Touch targets ≥44×44px
- Bottom navigation (thumb reach)
- Desktop = responsive bonus, NOT priority

---

## 📊 USAGE FREQUENCY (All Views Active)

| View | Frequency | Usage Pattern |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| **Daily** | Every day | 7 days/week |
| **Weekly** | Couple times/week | 2-3 times/week (HEAVY) |
| **Monthly** | Once a week | 4-5 times/month |
| **Yearly** | Every two weeks | 2-3 times/month |
| **Life** | Every 2 weeks - 1 month | 2-4 times/month |

**Key Insight:** ALL views will be actively used. This is not "set and forget."

---

## 🔄 CHECKOUT PATTERN (Consistent Across Time Scales)

**Daily Checkout** (exists):
- End of day reflection
- "For tomorrow" section (light planning)

**Weekly Checkout** (needed):
- End of week analysis
- "How did week go?"
- "What can I improve?"
- "What did I learn?"
- "For next week" section (light planning)

**Monthly Review** (needed):
- End of month reflection
- "What worked? What didn't?"
- "Did I hit monthly goals?"
- "For next month" section (planning half in advance)

**Pattern:**
- Same structure across time scales
- Reflection questions
- Learning capture
- Forward-looking section (light planning)
- NOT full detailed planning - just high-level focus

## 📝 GOAL HIERARCHY (Critical Understanding)

```
LIFE GOALS (10+ years)
  └─ "Financial Freedom"
  └─ "Peak Physical Health"
  └─ "Build Massive Impact Company"
      ↓
ANNUAL GOALS (1 year - "Breakup of life goals")
  └─ "200 workouts" (→ Peak Health)
  └─ "SISO profitability" (→ Impact Company)
  └─ "500 deep work hours" (→ Financial Freedom)
      ↓
MONTHLY GOALS ("Overreaching goals")
  └─ "20 workouts" (→ 200 yearly)
  └─ "Close 5 clients" (→ SISO revenue)
  └─ "Log 80 hours" (→ 500 yearly)
      ↓
"GOALS IN BETWEEN" (Weekly/sub-goals)
  └─ Week 1: Outreach (→ Close clients)
  └─ Week 2: Calls
  └─ Week 3: Proposals
  └─ Week 4: Close
```

**Key Concept:**
- Life goals → Annual goals → Monthly goals → Weekly sub-goals
- Each level is a breakdown of the level above
- Shows relationship/alignment
