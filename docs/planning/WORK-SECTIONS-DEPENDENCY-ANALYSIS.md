# Work Sections Dependency Analysis
**Date**: 2025-10-12
**Question**: What stays shared vs what moves to domain folders?

---

## 🎯 THE CRITICAL QUESTION

When migrating light-work and deep-work sections, what about:
- ✅ The hooks (`useLightWorkTasksSupabase`, `useDeepWorkTasksSupabase`)?
- ✅ The main component (`UnifiedWorkSection`)?
- ✅ All the sub-components (TaskHeader, SubtaskItem, etc.)?
- ✅ Database functionality?

**Answer**: They ALL stay where they are! Here's why...

---

## 📊 FULL DEPENDENCY TREE

### Layer 1: View Wrapper (What We're Moving)

```
lifelock/sections/LightFocusWorkSection.tsx (118 lines)
└─ Just maps props to UnifiedWorkSection
   └─ workType="LIGHT"
```

**Moving to**: `views/daily/light-work/LightFocusWorkSection.tsx`

---

### Layer 2: Shared Task Infrastructure (STAYS IN TASKS DOMAIN)

```
@/ecosystem/internal/tasks/
├── components/
│   └── UnifiedWorkSection.tsx (517 lines)
│       ├── Renders work tasks for ANY work type
│       ├── Used by: Light, Deep, Timeline, QuickScheduler
│       └── Imports from management/ (below)
│
├── management/
│   ├── TaskHeader.tsx
│   ├── SubtaskItem.tsx
│   ├── SubtaskMetadata.tsx
│   ├── TaskActionButtons.tsx
│   ├── TaskProgress.tsx
│   ├── TaskSeparator.tsx
│   ├── AddSubtaskInput.tsx
│   ├── TaskStatsGrid.tsx
│   └── WorkProtocolCard.tsx
│
└── hooks/
    ├── useLightWorkTasksSupabase.ts (26,127 lines!)
    ├── useDeepWorkTasksSupabase.ts (28,230 lines!)
    ├── useTaskEditing.ts
    ├── useTaskFiltering.ts
    └── useTaskReordering.ts
```

**WHY THEY STAY IN TASKS/**:
- ✅ Used by multiple domains (not just lifelock)
- ✅ Shared infrastructure layer
- ✅ Reused across 11+ files in different domains

## 🔍 WHO USES THESE (Usage Analysis)

### useLightWorkTasksSupabase - Used By:
1. `lifelock/sections/LightFocusWorkSection.tsx` (what we're migrating)
2. `siso-light-work-plan.tsx` (2 locations)
3. `tasks/components/LightFocusWorkSection-v2.tsx`
4. `tasks/components/QuickTaskScheduler.tsx`
5. `pages/OfflineTestPage.tsx`
6. `projects/hooks/useTimelineTasks.ts`

**= 6+ different files across 4 different domains!**

### useDeepWorkTasksSupabase - Used By:
1. `lifelock/sections/DeepFocusWorkSection.tsx` (what we're migrating)
2. `siso-deep-focus-plan.tsx` (2 locations)
3. `tasks/components/DeepFocusWorkSection-v2.tsx`
4. `tasks/components/QuickTaskScheduler.tsx`
5. `pages/OfflineTestPage.tsx`
6. `projects/hooks/useTimelineTasks.ts`

**= 6+ different files across 4 different domains!**

### UnifiedWorkSection - Used By:
1. `lifelock/sections/LightFocusWorkSection.tsx`
2. `lifelock/sections/DeepFocusWorkSection.tsx`
3. `tasks/components/LightFocusWorkSection-v2.tsx`
4. `tasks/components/DeepFocusWorkSection-v2.tsx`
5. `tasks/management/TaskActionButtons.tsx`
6. `tasks/management/TaskStatsGrid.tsx`
7. `tasks/management/WorkProtocolCard.tsx`
8. `calendar/ui/CustomCalendar.tsx`

**= 8 different files!**

---

## ✅ ARCHITECTURAL INSIGHT (This is Key!)

### What We're Migrating: VIEW LAYER ONLY

```
lifelock/views/daily/light-work/
└── LightFocusWorkSection.tsx
    ↓ (imports from shared infrastructure)
    @/ecosystem/internal/tasks/components/UnifiedWorkSection
    @/ecosystem/internal/tasks/hooks/useLightWorkTasksSupabase
```

### What STAYS Shared: INFRASTRUCTURE LAYER

```
@/ecosystem/internal/tasks/
├── hooks/
│   ├── useLightWorkTasksSupabase.ts  (✅ STAYS - used by 6+ files)
│   └── useDeepWorkTasksSupabase.ts   (✅ STAYS - used by 6+ files)
├── components/
│   └── UnifiedWorkSection.tsx        (✅ STAYS - used by 8+ files)
└── management/
    └── [9 sub-components]            (✅ STAYS - used by UnifiedWorkSection)
```

**This is CORRECT architecture**:
- ✅ View wrappers live with views (lifelock/views/daily/)
- ✅ Shared infrastructure stays shared (tasks/)
- ✅ No code duplication
- ✅ Multiple domains can use same infrastructure

---

## 🏗️ DOMAIN BOUNDARIES (What Goes Where)

### MOVE to lifelock/views/daily/:
- ✅ LightFocusWorkSection.tsx (view wrapper)
- ✅ DeepFocusWorkSection.tsx (view wrapper)
- ❌ NOT the hooks (used by 6+ files)
- ❌ NOT UnifiedWorkSection (used by 8 files)
- ❌ NOT management components (used by UnifiedWorkSection)

### STAY in tasks/:
- ✅ useLightWorkTasksSupabase (shared hook - 26K lines!)
- ✅ useDeepWorkTasksSupabase (shared hook - 28K lines!)
- ✅ UnifiedWorkSection (shared component - 517 lines)
- ✅ All management components (shared - 9 files)
- ✅ Task types/interfaces (shared across app)

---

## 💡 WHY THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM MORNING ROUTINE

### Morning Routine:
```
MorningRoutineSection.tsx (789 lines)
├── ALL logic was in one file
├── Custom trackers (water, push-ups) - SPECIFIC to morning routine
├── No other files used morning routine logic
└── Extracted into domain folder ✅ CORRECT
```

### Light/Deep Work:
```
LightFocusWorkSection.tsx (118 lines)
├── Just a thin wrapper (prop mapping)
├── Imports SHARED infrastructure (UnifiedWorkSection, hooks)
├── 6+ other files use same infrastructure
└── Only wrapper moves, infrastructure stays ✅ CORRECT
```

---

## 🎯 WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY MIGRATING

### Moving ONLY:
```
views/daily/light-work/
└── LightFocusWorkSection.tsx (118 lines - just the view wrapper)
```

### NOT Moving (Staying Shared):
```
@/ecosystem/internal/tasks/
├── hooks/useLightWorkTasksSupabase.ts  (26,127 lines - DATABASE LOGIC)
├── components/UnifiedWorkSection.tsx    (517 lines - WORK UI COMPONENT)
└── management/
    ├── TaskHeader.tsx                   (Task title/actions)
    ├── SubtaskItem.tsx                  (Subtask rendering)
    ├── SubtaskMetadata.tsx              (Priority/time/calendar)
    ├── TaskActionButtons.tsx            (CRUD buttons)
    ├── TaskProgress.tsx                 (Progress bar)
    ├── TaskSeparator.tsx                (Visual separator)
    ├── AddSubtaskInput.tsx              (Add subtask form)
    ├── TaskStatsGrid.tsx                (XP/time stats)
    └── WorkProtocolCard.tsx             (Work protocol display)
```

**Total infrastructure NOT moving**: ~55,000 lines of task management code!

---

## ✅ YOUR QUESTION ANSWERED

### "Is the database functionality going to be there?"

**YES!** ✅

- Database hooks stay in `tasks/hooks/` (where they belong)
- Used by 6+ files across multiple domains
- Moving would break: QuickTaskScheduler, Timeline, siso-focus-plans, Test pages

### "What about calendar, priority, subtask components?"

**YES!** ✅

All these live in `tasks/management/` and are imported by UnifiedWorkSection:
- ✅ Priority selector (in SubtaskMetadata)
- ✅ Calendar picker (in SubtaskMetadata)
- ✅ Subtask components (SubtaskItem, AddSubtaskInput)
- ✅ Task actions (TaskActionButtons)
- ✅ Progress display (TaskProgress)

**They ALL stay in tasks/ because they're shared infrastructure!**

---

## 🏛️ ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLE

### Separation of Concerns

**View Layer** (lifelock/views/daily/):
- How we DISPLAY light/deep work in daily view
- Just presentation/orchestration
- Thin wrappers (100-200 lines)

**Infrastructure Layer** (tasks/):
- HOW tasks work (database, sync, offline-first)
- WHAT tasks look like (UnifiedWorkSection rendering)
- HOW to edit tasks (management components)
- Shared across entire app

**This is GOOD architecture** - don't change it!

---

## 📋 REVISED MIGRATION PLAN

### What's Actually Happening:

**Phase 1: Light Work** (5 min)
```bash
# 1. Create folder
mkdir -p views/daily/light-work

# 2. Copy wrapper file ONLY (118 lines)
cp sections/LightFocusWorkSection.tsx views/daily/light-work/

# 3. Update import in admin-lifelock-tabs.ts
#    (1 line change)

# 4. Test (all infrastructure already there)

# 5. Archive old wrapper

# 6. Commit
```

**Phase 2: Deep Work** (5 min)
Same steps, different folder.

---

## 🎯 WHAT STAYS IN SHARED TASKS DOMAIN

```
@/ecosystem/internal/tasks/  (DO NOT MOVE!)

    ├── AddSubtaskInput.tsx              ← SUBTASK FORM
    └── [5 more management components]
```

**Used by**: LifeLock, Tasks pages, QuickScheduler, Timeline, Test pages

**If we moved these**: Would break 6+ other parts of the app!

---

## ✅ CONCLUSION

### Your Concerns Addressed:

**Q**: "Are the hooks going to be there?"
**A**: ✅ YES - hooks stay in `tasks/hooks/` (shared infrastructure)

**Q**: "What about database functionality?"
**A**: ✅ YES - all in `useLightWorkTasksSupabase` (26K lines, stays shared)

**Q**: "Calendar components?"
**A**: ✅ YES - in `SubtaskMetadata.tsx` in `tasks/management/` (stays shared)

**Q**: "Priority listing components?"
**A**: ✅ YES - in `SubtaskMetadata.tsx` (stays shared)

**Q**: "Subtask components?"
**A**: ✅ YES - `SubtaskItem.tsx`, `AddSubtaskInput.tsx` in `tasks/management/` (stays shared)

**ALL functionality preserved** - we're only moving the thin view wrappers!

---

## 🚀 SAFE TO PROCEED

### What We're Moving:
- LightFocusWorkSection.tsx (118 lines - just wrapper)
- DeepFocusWorkSection.tsx (109 lines - just wrapper)

### What We're NOT Moving:
- All hooks (stay in tasks/hooks/)
- UnifiedWorkSection (stays in tasks/components/)
- All management components (stay in tasks/management/)
- All database logic (in the hooks)

**Everything will work** - the wrappers import from shared infrastructure!

---

## 📁 FINAL STRUCTURE AFTER MIGRATION

```
views/daily/
├── light-work/
│   └── LightFocusWorkSection.tsx
│       ↓ imports (STAYS SHARED)
│       @/ecosystem/internal/tasks/components/UnifiedWorkSection
│       @/ecosystem/internal/tasks/hooks/useLightWorkTasksSupabase
│
└── deep-work/
    └── DeepFocusWorkSection.tsx
        ↓ imports (STAYS SHARED)
        @/ecosystem/internal/tasks/components/UnifiedWorkSection
        @/ecosystem/internal/tasks/hooks/useDeepWorkTasksSupabase

@/ecosystem/internal/tasks/ (ALL STAYS HERE)
├── hooks/ (26K-28K lines per hook - database layer)
├── components/UnifiedWorkSection.tsx (517 lines - UI layer)
└── management/ (9 sub-components - UI layer)
```

**All functionality intact** ✅

---

## ✅ VERIFIED: SAFE TO MIGRATE

**Hooks**: Stay shared (used by 6+ files)
**Components**: Stay shared (used by 8+ files)
**Database**: In the hooks (staying shared)
**UI Components**: In management/ (staying shared)

**We're ONLY moving the view wrappers** - architecture is correct!
