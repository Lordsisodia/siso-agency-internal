## üü° P1 (HIGH PRIORITY) ISSUES

### Issue #1: "Use Now" Button Overflow on Mobile

**Status**: üî¥ NEEDS FIX

**Description**:
- "Use Now (13:29)" button extends off screen on mobile
- Text gets cut off on smaller screens

**Location**:
- `views/daily/morning-routine/components/WakeUpTimeTracker.tsx`
- OR inline in MorningRoutineSection (wake-up time section)

**Screenshot**: Provided by user

**Fix Needed**:
```typescript
// Current (likely):
<Button className="... whitespace-nowrap">
  Use Now (13:29)
</Button>

// Fix options:
1. Make button responsive width
2. Shorten text on mobile ("Now" instead of "Use Now")
3. Stack buttons vertically on mobile
4. Reduce padding/font size
```

**Priority**: HIGH (UX issue on mobile)

### Issue #2: TimeScrollPicker Scrolling Difficult

**Status**: üî¥ NEEDS FIX

**Description**:
- Scroll wheel time picker is hard to scroll
- Scrolling behavior not smooth or responsive
- May be iOS-specific issue

**Location**:

- Used by WakeUpTimeTracker for wake-up time selection

**Possible Causes**:
- Touch event handling
- Scroll snap not working properly
- iOS momentum scrolling disabled
- Conflicting event listeners

**Fix Needed**:
- Improve scroll sensitivity
- Add better touch handling
- Enable iOS momentum scrolling
- Test on actual iPhone

**Priority**: HIGH (core interaction issue)
