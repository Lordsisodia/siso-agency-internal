# üéØ SISO Internal: Deep Focus Work Feature PRD

**Product Manager**: John (BMAD PM)  
**Project**: SISO Internal - LifeLock Deep Focus Work Integration  
**Type**: Brownfield Enhancement PRD  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: September 12, 2025  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Missing Core Feature  

---

## üìä Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Existing Project Overview
**Analysis Source**: IDE-based fresh analysis + BMAD Analyst Report (Mary's comprehensive assessment)

**Current Project State**: 
SISO Internal operates as a sophisticated productivity ecosystem with a **LifeLock system** designed to manage daily workflows. The system currently has 6 planned productivity features:

1. ‚úÖ **Morning Routine** - Fully implemented and integrated
2. ‚ùå **Deep Focus Work** - **COMPLETELY MISSING** (THIS PRD)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Light Focus Work** - Fragmented (4+ versions, not integrated)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Nightly Checkout** - Sophisticated but isolated
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Home Workout** - Implemented but isolated
6. ‚úÖ **Timebox System** - Well developed and integrated

**Critical Architecture Issue**: Only MorningRoutineSection exists in the core `/src/ecosystem/internal/lifelock/sections/` directory, while other features exist as isolated components in `/ai-first/features/tasks/`.

### Enhancement Scope Assessment
This is a **SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENT** requiring:
- Full feature implementation from zero
- Architecture integration into existing LifeLock system
- Database design and API development
- UI/UX implementation following established patterns
- Testing and quality assurance

**Complexity Justification**: This cannot be completed in 1-2 development sessions as it requires comprehensive planning, multiple coordinated stories, and architectural integration.

### User Impact
- **Productivity Gap**: Users lack dedicated deep work time management
- **System Inconsistency**: Tabs reference non-existent functionality
- **Workflow Incompleteness**: Daily productivity cycle missing essential component
- **User Frustration**: Expected feature unavailable, breaking user mental model

### Business Impact
- **Product Completeness**: Core feature missing from productivity suite
- **User Experience**: Broken navigation and incomplete workflows
- **Technical Debt**: Architecture inconsistency and configuration mismatch

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Reference Implementation Pattern
**Model**: `MorningRoutineSection.tsx` - the only properly integrated LifeLock feature

**Architecture Components**:
1. **Main Component**: `/src/ecosystem/internal/lifelock/sections/DeepFocusWorkSection.tsx`
2. **Database Hook**: Custom Supabase hook (e.g., `useDeepFocusSupabase`)
3. **API Layer**: Focus session management endpoints
4. **UI Components**: Reusable focus timer, session controls, analytics dashboards

### Database Schema Design
```sql
-- Deep Focus Sessions Table
create table deep_focus_sessions (
  id uuid default gen_random_uuid() primary key,
  user_id text not null,
  date date not null,
  session_type text not null, -- 'creative', 'analytical', 'learning', etc.
  planned_duration_minutes integer not null,
  actual_duration_minutes integer,
  completed boolean default false,
  focus_quality_rating integer, -- 1-5 scale
  session_notes text,
  distractions_count integer default 0,
  break_intervals jsonb, -- Track break patterns
  created_at timestamptz default now(),
  updated_at timestamptz default now()
);

-- Daily Deep Work Summary
create table daily_deep_work_summary (
  id uuid default gen_random_uuid() primary key,
  user_id text not null,
  date date not null unique,
  total_planned_minutes integer default 0,
  total_actual_minutes integer default 0,
  total_sessions integer default 0,
  completed_sessions integer default 0,
  average_focus_quality decimal,
  productivity_score decimal, -- Calculated metric
  created_at timestamptz default now(),
  updated_at timestamptz default now()
);
```

### Integration Points
1. **Tab Configuration**: Update `admin-lifelock-tabs.ts` to point to actual component
2. **Navigation**: Seamless tab switching between LifeLock features
3. **Data Sharing**: Cross-feature data access for integrated analytics
4. **Component Reuse**: Leverage existing animations, UI components, and patterns
