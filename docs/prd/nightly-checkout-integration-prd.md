## 📊 Problem Statement

### Core Problem
**Nightly Checkout is the most sophisticated LifeLock feature but is completely isolated** from the main system. This "crown jewel" feature offers exceptional daily reflection capabilities but users cannot access it through the integrated LifeLock workflow.

**Current State Analysis (Mary's Assessment)**:
✅ **Exceptional Implementation Quality**:
- Full database integration with `daily-reflections` API
- Advanced voice processing and AI analysis capabilities
- Sophisticated data model (wentWell, evenBetterIf, analysis, patterns)
- Motion animations and excellent UX
- Comprehensive reflection framework

❌ **Complete System Isolation**:
- Exists in `/ai-first/features/tasks/components/NightlyCheckoutSection.tsx`
- NOT accessible via main LifeLock interface
- Missing from core `/lifelock/sections/` directory
- No integration with daily workflow progression

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
1. **Feature Access**: Nightly Checkout accessible via main LifeLock interface
2. **Workflow Completion**: >60% of users complete full daily cycle (Morning → Work → Checkout)
3. **Reflection Quality**: Average reflection completeness >80% (all sections filled)
4. **User Engagement**: >3 weekly reflections per user average

### Quality Metrics
- **Performance**: Feature loads in <2s maintaining existing functionality
- **Data Integrity**: 100% preservation of existing reflection data and functionality
- **Integration**: Seamless workflow from other LifeLock features
- **Voice Processing**: Maintain current AI analysis capabilities
