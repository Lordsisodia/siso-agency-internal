## Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Auto-save**: Prevent data loss with frequent saves
2. **Progress Tracking**: Clear visual feedback
3. **Performance**: Optimize for mobile typing
4. **Accessibility**: Screen reader support

### For Users
1. **Consistency**: Complete reflection daily
2. **Honesty**: Be truthful in assessments
3. **Specificity**: Use concrete examples
4. **Action-orientation**: Focus on improvements

## Reflection Techniques

### Structured Reflection
1. **Start with Positives**: Always begin with what went well
2. **Be Specific**: Use concrete examples, not generalities
3. **Focus on Growth**: Frame improvements as learning opportunities
4. **End with Action**: Create clear next steps

### Quality Questions
- Instead of "How was your day?" ask "What did you accomplish?"
- Instead of "Did you fail?" ask "What did you learn?"
- Instead of "What went wrong?" ask "What would you improve?"

### Pattern Recognition
- Look for recurring themes
- Identify energy patterns
- Note decision quality trends
- Track habit formation progress

## Data Persistence

### Auto-save Mechanism
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!userId || isLoading || !hasUserEdited) return;
  
  const saveTimer = setTimeout(async () => {
    await saveReflection(nightlyCheckout);
    setHasUserEdited(false);
  }, 1000); // Debounce for 1 second

  return () => clearTimeout(saveTimer);
}, [nightlyCheckout, userId, isLoading, hasUserEdited]);
```

### Progress Calculation
```typescript
const calculateProgress = () => {
  let completed = 0;
  const total = 6;
  
  if (nightlyCheckout.wentWell.some(item => item.trim() !== '')) completed++;
  if (nightlyCheckout.evenBetterIf.some(item => item.trim() !== '')) completed++;
  if (nightlyCheckout.dailyAnalysis?.trim()) completed++;
  if (nightlyCheckout.actionItems?.trim()) completed++;
  if (nightlyCheckout.keyLearnings?.trim()) completed++;
  if (nightlyCheckout.tomorrowFocus?.trim()) completed++;
  
  return total > 0 ? (completed / total) * 100 : 0;
};
```
