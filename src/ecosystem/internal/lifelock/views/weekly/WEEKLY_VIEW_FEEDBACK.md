# LifeLock Weekly View Feedback (2025-10-17)

Tracking user-reported UX issues for the Weekly View:

1. **Missing global background**  
   - Daily view uses the uniform charcoal background; Weekly view should match.

2. **Perceived auto-refresh**  
   - Animated week progress bar creates a refreshing feel; needs smoother, less intrusive behaviour.

3. **Static XP header**  
   - The “Week of Oct 13 – 20” XP progress card is unnecessary right now.

4. **Daily view CTA card**  
   - “Go to Daily View” card is too wide/heavy; requires a minimal treatment.

5. **7-day performance layout**  
   - Day cards must consume full width (one card per row) for clarity.

6. **Mock data**  
   - Fine to remain mocked for now; ensure UI changes don’t assume real data.

Resolution status is tracked directly in git history alongside code changes.

## 2025-10-17 Updates

- Added dedicated Weekly Goals tab (bottom nav) with manual goal entry flow.
- Rebuilt overview card layout; next iteration should surface high-level goal status once data wiring exists.
