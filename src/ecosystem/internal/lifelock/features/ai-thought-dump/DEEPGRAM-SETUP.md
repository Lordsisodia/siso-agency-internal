## 🚀 Setup Steps (5 Minutes Total)

### **Step 1: Get FREE Deepgram API Key** (2 minutes)

1. **Visit:** https://console.deepgram.com/signup

2. **Sign up:**
   - Use your email
   - No credit card required
   - Free tier: **45,000 minutes/year** (123 min/day!)
   - OR $200 free credits

3. **Get API key:**
   - After signup → Dashboard
   - Look for "API Keys" section
   - Click "Create a New API Key"
   - Copy the key (starts with something like `abc123...`)

### **Step 2: Add Key to .env** (30 seconds)

Open `.env` file and replace line 20:

```bash
# BEFORE:
VITE_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE

# AFTER:
VITE_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here
```

### **Step 3: Restart Dev Server** (10 seconds)

```bash
npm run dev
```

### **Step 4: Clear Old Failed Queue** (30 seconds)

**IMPORTANT:** Auto-cleanup is now enabled! The system will automatically clear broken records on startup.

Look for this in console:
```
🧹 [AUTO-CLEANUP] Removing X broken daily_health sync actions...
✅ [AUTO-CLEANUP] Broken actions cleared - sync will work now!
```

If you don't see it, it means queue is already clean. ✅

### **Step 5: Test!** (2 minutes)

1. Go to Morning Routine tab
2. Click AI Thought Dump button
3. Click green **"Start Talking"** button
4. **Speak:** "I need to finish the proposal and call the client"
5. **Watch:** Words appear in real-time as you speak! 🎉
6. **Pause 300ms** → AI responds
7. **Keep talking** → Natural conversation
8. Click **"End Conversation"** when done

## ❌ Troubleshooting

### **Problem: "Deepgram API key not configured"**
**Solution:**
- Check `.env` file has correct key on line 20
- Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
- Key should NOT be `YOUR_KEY_HERE`

### **Problem: "Using Web Speech API (Fallback)"**
**Cause:** Deepgram key not detected
**Check:**
```javascript
// Browser console:
console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY)
```
Should show your key, not `undefined`

### **Problem: WebSocket Connection Error**
**Causes:**
1. Invalid API key
2. Network firewall blocking WebSocket
3. Deepgram service down (rare)

**Solution:**
- Verify API key is correct
- Check console for specific error
- Falls back to Web Speech API automatically

### **Problem: No Words Appearing**
**Check:**
1. Microphone permission granted?
2. Console shows "✅ [DEEPGRAM] Streaming started"?
3. Speaking loud enough?
4. Try refreshing page

### **Problem: Database Save Errors**
**Fixed automatically!** The system now:
- Strips invalid IDs from daily_health records
- Uses proper upsert with conflict resolution
- Auto-cleans broken records on startup

## 🎯 How It Works (Technical Overview)

### **Real-Time Conversation Flow:**

```
1. User clicks "Start Talking"
   ↓
2. Get microphone permission
   ↓
3. Open WebSocket to Deepgram
   wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen
   ↓
4. Start MediaRecorder (250ms chunks)
   ↓
5. Stream audio → Deepgram WebSocket
   ↓
6. Deepgram returns transcripts:
   - Interim results (words as you speak)
   - Final results (after 300ms silence)
   ↓
7. UI updates in real-time:
   setTranscript(text) ← Shows live
   ↓
8. On final result (sentence complete):
   - Send to gpt-4o-mini
   - AI processes & responds
   - Play response via TTS
   - Keep listening! (continuous)
   ↓
9. User keeps talking
   - New sentence detected
   - Process & respond
   - Back-and-forth naturally
   ↓
10. User clicks "End Conversation"
    - Stop WebSocket
    - Clean up resources
    - Organize tasks
```

### **Key Parameters:**

**Audio Capture:**
- Format: `audio/webm;codecs=opus`
- Sample rate: 16kHz
- Chunk size: 250ms (ultra-responsive)

**Deepgram Config:**
- Model: `nova-2` (latest, most accurate)
- Language: `en-US`
- Punctuate: `true` (auto-add punctuation)
- Interim results: `true` (real-time words)
- Endpointing: `300ms` (silence = sentence done)

**Conversation Logic:**
- Interim: Update UI (show words)
- Final: Send to AI + clear transcript + keep listening
- Continuous mode until user stops

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### **Change Deepgram Model:**

Edit `voice.service.ts:173`:
```typescript
{
  model: 'nova-2',        // Default (best accuracy)
  // OR
  model: 'nova',          // Faster, slightly less accurate
  // OR
  model: 'base',          // Cheapest (for testing)
}
```

### **Adjust Silence Detection:**

Edit `voice.service.ts:176`:
```typescript
endpointing: 300,  // Default: 300ms pause = send
// Shorter = More responsive, might cut off mid-sentence
// Longer = Less responsive, more complete sentences
```

### **Change Language:**

Edit `voice.service.ts:173`:
```typescript
language: 'en-US',  // Default
// OR
language: 'en-GB',  // British English
language: 'es',     // Spanish
language: 'fr',     // French
// 36+ languages supported!
```
