# SISO Ecosystem Architecture Analysis

This folder contains my ongoing analysis of the SISO-INTERNAL project architecture.

## Analysis Approach

I'll be systematically examining:
1. Overall project structure and organization
2. Service architecture and patterns
3. Component organization
4. Data flow and state management
5. Integration patterns
6. Architectural decisions and trade-offs
