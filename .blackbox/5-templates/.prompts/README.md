# Prompt Packs (`.blackbox/.prompts/`)

This folder contains **prompt packs**: reusable, staged instructions agents can run for long work.

Conventions:
- Keep prompts as markdown (`.md`).
- Keep this directory **flat** (no subfolders) to stay easy to scan.

Inputs vs outputs:
- Prompt packs live here (inputs).
- Outputs should be written into `docs/.blackbox/.runs/<run>/`.
