# Scoring Rubric (0–100)

Use this rubric to rank every major idea/finding.

## Components
- **Impact (0–25)**: if true, how much does it move metrics or strategy?
- **Feasibility (0–20)**: can we ship it with our stack + team?
- **Evidence quality (0–20)**: how strong/credible is the supporting info?
- **Novelty / differentiation (0–15)**: does it make us meaningfully different?
- **Time-to-value (0–10)**: how quickly can we see benefits?
- **Risk profile (0–10)**: execution + operational + product risks (higher = safer)

## Output requirements per ranked item
Each item must include:
- Title + one-line thesis
- Evidence bullets (with links/paths)
- Assumptions
- Next step (actionable)
- Score breakdown (per component)
