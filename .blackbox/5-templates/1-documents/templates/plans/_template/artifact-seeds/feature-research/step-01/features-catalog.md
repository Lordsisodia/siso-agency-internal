# Features Catalog (Feature Hunt)

Purpose: build a **comprehensive feature universe** we can later rank for “vibe coding” (fast integration).

## ✅ How to use

- Keep this **broad** at first (capture everything).
- Later, the synthesis agent will dedupe and rank.

## 🧭 Taxonomy (use consistently)

- Admin / operations
- Merchandising / CRO
- Retention / lifecycle
- Analytics / experiments
- Content / SEO
- Customer / support
- Platform primitives (flags, jobs, audit logs, permissions)
