# Reviews

Every **10 compactions** (≈100 steps), create a review doc here to:

1) Identify patterns that improve agent performance (better prompts, better checklists, better stop conditions).
2) Decide what content is actually durable/valuable and delete the rest.

Suggested workflow:

- Read the last 10 compaction files.
- Write one review file: `review-0001.md`, `review-0002.md`, …
- Apply cleanup by editing `context/context.md` and leaving only durable takeaways.
