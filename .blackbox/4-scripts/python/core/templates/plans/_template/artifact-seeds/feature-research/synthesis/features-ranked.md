# Features Ranked (Top 30 Scorecards)

For each feature:
- Why it matters (ROI)
- Complexity (S/M/L)
- OSS accelerators (if any)
- Competitors that prove demand

## Scoring rubric (0–10 each; total /50)

- ROI: conversion, retention, ops time saved
- Feasibility: how fast we can ship an MVP
- Integration leverage: how much OSS/known patterns accelerate this
- Maintenance risk (reverse): lower risk = higher score
- Evidence strength: number/quality of competitors + sources
