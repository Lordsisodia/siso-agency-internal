# 📋 Docs Black Box — Tasks

## Active
- [x] Define the canonical `.blackbox` template structure
- [x] Add starter agents (docs feedback)
- [x] Add scaffolding scripts (new plan, new agent, new run, promote, check)
- [ ] Keep `deepresearch/index.md` current as new evergreen notes are added (promote appends automatically)
- [ ] Ensure every meaningful doc change is logged in `docs/08-meta/repo/docs-ledger.md`
- [ ] Archive old runs in `agents/.plans/_archive/` when `agents/.plans/` gets noisy

## Backlog
- [x] Decide where “snapshots” and large artifacts should live (gitignore heavy raw artifacts by default)
- [x] Add schema templates for agent outputs (`schemas/`)
