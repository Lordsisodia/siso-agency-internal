## CONTEXT

Use the shared Deep Research Context Pack (copy/paste into your run as needed):
- `context-pack.md`

## PROMPT

TASK:
Research subscription and bundling solutions used by Shopify DTC (beauty focus if possible).

1) Identify key tools (subscriptions, bundles/kits, memberships) and their feature sets: proration, swap, prepaid, pause/resume, discounts, churn tools, customer portal, analytics.
2) Document Shopify integration patterns, limitations, and typical merchant pain points.
3) Recommend: for our platform, what should be:
   - integrated (best-in-class vendor)
   - built (lightweight native)
   - left to Shopify/apps

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Competitor table + citations.
- “Decision framework” for future clients (when to pick which approach).
