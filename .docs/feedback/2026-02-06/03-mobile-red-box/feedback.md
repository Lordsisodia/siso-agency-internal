# Feedback Item 3: Mobile PWA Red Box Issue

## Current Issue
A red box is appearing at the top of the PWA screen on mobile devices. This is taking up valuable screen real estate.

## Desired Outcome
1. Remove the red box completely
2. Use that space for the day selector section
3. Extend the lighter grey background color to the very top of the screen

## Visual Changes
- Remove red box/header area
- Day selector should move up into that space
- Background color should be consistent (lighter grey) from top to bottom

## Affected Areas
- PWA manifest/theme colors
- Mobile viewport settings
- Header/navigation components
- Day selector positioning

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Red box no longer appears at top of mobile PWA
- [ ] Day selector is positioned higher on screen
- [ ] Background color is consistent from top edge
- [ ] Works correctly in PWA mode (standalone display)
- [ ] No visual glitches or overlapping elements
