# Friday 6th February 2026 - LifeLock Feedback

## 1. Morning Routine & Nightly Checkout Toggle Behavior
**Current:** Toggle sections stay open after completion
**Desired:** Once info is entered and section is complete, it should auto-close but remain toggleable with a green completion icon indicator

---

## 2. Day Progress Bar Relocation
**Current:** Horizontal 100% progress bar below day selector dropdown
**Desired:** Move to left-hand side of screen as a vertical bar (alongside the existing colour-changing vertical line on mobile)

---

## 3. Mobile PWA Red Box Issue
**Current:** Red box appearing at top of PWA screen on mobile
**Desired:** Remove the red box, use that space for the day selector section, extend the lighter grey background to the top

---

## 4. Bottom Navigation Grey Box Blocking Content
**Current:** Grey box behind AI icon and 4-button bottom navigation is blocking page content from scrolling underneath
**Desired:** Fix scrolling so content can scroll behind/beneath the bottom nav properly

---

## 5. XP Balance Display
**Current:** No XP balance visible at top of page
**Desired:** Show total XP balance to the left of the user icon at top of page

---

## 6. Morning Routine - "Coding My Brain" Text Layout
**Current:** Text appears as one paragraph block
**Desired:** Separate each sentence onto its own line for better readability

---

## 7. Flow State Rules & Statistics Enhancement
**Idea:** Revamp flow state rules/statistics display
**Potential additions:**
- Weekly graph view
- XP earned each day so far
- Wake up statistics
- Sleep statistics
- Calorie tracking visualization
