# BlackBox5 Research Analysis - Executive Summary

> Quick reference for decision makers
> Analysis Date: 2026-01-18

## TL;DR

**15 research frameworks analyzed. 3 must-have features identified. 30-week implementation roadmap.**

BlackBox5 should evolve from a skill-based agent system to a **spec-driven, memory-enabled, GitHub-native AI agent engine** with visual coordination and production-ready security.

---

## Top 3 Must-Have Features

### 1. Spec-Driven Development Pipeline ⭐⭐⭐
**Source**: CCPM, Auto-Claude
**Impact**: VERY HIGH
**Effort**: 6 weeks
**Timeline**: Q2

Transform from "vibe coding" to full traceability:
- Brainstorm → Plan → Decompose → Execute → Track
- GitHub Issues as single source of truth
- Parallel agent execution (5-8x faster)
- Seamless human-AI handoffs

### 2. Knowledge Graph Memory System ⭐⭐⭐
**Source**: Cognee
**Impact**: VERY HIGH
**Effort**: 8 weeks
**Timeline**: Q2-Q3

Persistent memory using ECL pipeline:
- Extract: Skill executions, agent communications
- Cognify: Build knowledge graph of relationships
- Load: Query via vector + graph hybrid search

### 3. Mayor Pattern Orchestrator ⭐⭐⭐
**Source**: Gastown
**Impact**: VERY HIGH
**Effort**: 6 weeks
**Timeline**: Q2

Dedicated coordinator agent:
- Full workspace context
- Goal decomposition
- Agent spawning and management
- Progress tracking and synthesis

## What to Avoid

❌ **Direct API usage** - Use SDK abstractions
❌ **Platform scattered checks** - Centralize in platform module
❌ **Automatic pushes** - User controls when code goes remote
❌ **Vibe coding** - Explicit specs for all work
❌ **Context window pollution** - Main thread stays strategic
❌ **Complex setup** - Work with standard tools
❌ **Manual platform testing** - Multi-platform CI from day 1

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Weeks 1-4)
- Context requirements schema
- GitHub integration
- Skill metadata
- Thinking mode detection

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure (Weeks 5-12)
- Knowledge graph memory
- Mayor orchestrator
- Security model

### Phase 3: Spec-Driven Development (Weeks 13-18)
- Full spec-to-code pipeline
- GitHub-native workflow
- Formula-based workflows

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Weeks 19-30)
- E2E testing
- Spatial coordination UI
- Session genealogy

---

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1
✅ All skills have context requirements
✅ GitHub integration working
✅ Context quality measurable

### Phase 2
✅ Memory persists across sessions
✅ Mayor coordinates 10+ agents
✅ Security model prevents abuse

### Phase 3
✅ Full spec-to-code traceability
✅ Zero "vibe coding"
✅ Repeatable workflows

### Phase 4
✅ E2E tests for all changes
✅ Visual coordination UI
✅ Production-ready

## Key Insights

1. **Spec-Driven > Vibe Coding**: Every skill needs explicit requirements
2. **Memory is Essential**: Agents must learn from past executions
3. **Coordination Matters**: Single coordinator scales better
4. **Security is Critical**: Production systems need defense-in-depth
5. **Context Engineering**: Systematic assembly, not random inclusion
