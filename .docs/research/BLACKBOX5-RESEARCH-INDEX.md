## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Which framework should I study first?

**A**: Start with **CCPM** (spec-driven development) and **Awesome Context Engineering** (theoretical framework). These provide the foundation for everything else.

### Q: What's the minimum viable Phase 1?

**A**: Implement Context Requirements Schema (Week 1) and GitHub Integration (Week 2). These two features alone will significantly improve BlackBox5.

### Q: Can I skip phases?

**A**: Yes, but not recommended. Phase 1 features are prerequisites for Phase 2-4. However, you can implement Phase 1 features in any order.

### Q: What if I only have 1 week?

**A**: Implement Context Requirements Schema. It's the highest-impact, lowest-effort feature.

### Q: How do I prioritize within Phase 1?

**A**:
1. Context Requirements Schema (highest impact)
2. GitHub Integration (highest visibility)
3. Skill Metadata (enables orchestration)
4. Thinking Mode (nice to have)

### Q: What's the ROI?

**A**:
- Phase 1: 5-10x improvement in context quality
- Phase 2: 20-30x improvement in agent coordination
- Phase 3: 5-8x faster feature delivery
- Phase 4: Production-ready deployment
