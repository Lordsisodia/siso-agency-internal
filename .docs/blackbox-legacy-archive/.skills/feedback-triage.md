# Skill: Feedback Triage

## Purpose
Turn messy qualitative feedback into a **prioritized, actionable backlog** with clear ownership and next steps.

## Trigger (when to use)
- New feedback lands (doc dump, QA notes, screenshots)
- Pre-release review
- Weekly “hygiene” pass

## Outputs (artifacts)
1. A plan folder in `.blackbox/.plans/`
2. A triage report in that plan folder (suggested: `triage-report.md`)

## Taxonomy
For each item:
- Type: bug / UX confusion / missing feature / performance / data / docs
- Severity: blocker / high / medium / low
- Confidence: confirmed / likely / speculative
- Surface: UI / backend / database / architecture / docs

## Output format (suggested)
- Summary
- Themes
- Backlog (prioritized)
- Open questions
