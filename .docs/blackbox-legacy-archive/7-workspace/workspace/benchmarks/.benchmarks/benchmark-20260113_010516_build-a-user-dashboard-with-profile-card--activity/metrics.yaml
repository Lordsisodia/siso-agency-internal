    satisfaction: 9

  notes: |
    Multi-agent workflow: PM → UX Designer → Architect → Dev
    - PM: Complete requirements with user stories
    - UX: Design system, colors, typography, layouts
    - Architect: Component hierarchy, TypeScript interfaces
    - Dev: Implementation following specs

    Strengths:
    - Design decisions documented with rationale
    - Requirements explicit (user stories, acceptance criteria)
    - Architecture prevents refactoring
    - Team-ready documentation
    - Easy to hand off/maintain

    Artifacts:
    - 01-requirements.md (PRD)
    - 02-ux-design.md (Design system)
    - 03-architecture.md (Technical design)
    - Implementation following specs

  quality:
    code_quality: 7
    mental_load: 5 (all decisions in head)
    maintainability: 6 (minimal documentation)
    reusability: 6 (ad-hoc decisions)
    satisfaction: 7

  notes: |
    Direct prompt → code generation
    - No requirements phase
    - No design phase
    - No architecture phase
    - Just implementation

    Strengths:
    - Very fast to first code
    - Low token usage
    - Simple for one person

    Weaknesses:
    - Design decisions implicit, not documented
    - No requirements traceability
    - Harder to hand off to team
    - May need refactoring later
    - No reusable design system

    ## Summary: Real-World Benchmark on Moderate Task

    This was a MUCH better benchmark than email validation. The User Dashboard
    task actually benefits from structured multi-agent workflows.

    ### Raw AI (Without Blackbox3) - Won On:
    - Speed: 5.7x faster to first code (90s vs 600s)
    - Tokens: 60% fewer used
    - Simplicity: Just prompt and go
    - Best for: Solo work, quick prototypes

    ### Blackbox3 - Won On:
    - Code Quality: +29% better
    - Mental Load: -60% (framework handles the thinking)
    - Maintainability: +67% better
    - Reusability: +50% better
    - Documentation: 800 lines of design docs vs minimal README
    - Team readiness: Production handoff ready
    - Best for: Team projects, production code, long-term maintenance

    ### The Break-Even Point

    **Use Raw AI when:**
    - Solo developer
    - Quick prototype/MVP
    - Throwaway code
    - Time pressure
    - Simple requirements

    **Use Blackbox3 when:**
    - Team project (need to hand off)
    - Production code (long-term maintenance)
    - Complex requirements (need structure)
    - Design system (need consistency)
    - Multiple stakeholders

    ### Key Insight

    Raw AI gets you to code faster. Blackbox3 gets you to **better**
    code with **documented decisions** and **team readiness**.

    The 10-minute "overhead" of Blackbox3 (PM → UX → Architect) pays
    dividends in:
    - No refactoring needed later
    - Design system established
    - Requirements traceability
    - Easy onboarding for new devs

    ### For This Task (Moderate UI Development)

    If I'm building a dashboard for MYSELF: Raw AI all the way.
    If I'm building a dashboard for a TEAM: Blackbox3, definitely.

    The multi-agent workflow creates artifacts that have lasting value
    beyond the initial implementation.
