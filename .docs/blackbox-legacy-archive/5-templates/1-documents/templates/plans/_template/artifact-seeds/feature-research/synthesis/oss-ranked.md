# OSS Ranked (Top 50 Scorecards)

For each repo:
- License clarity
- Integration path (API vs embed)
- Maintenance signal
- Feature mapping

## Scoring rubric (0–10 each; total /50)

- License safety: permissive clarity beats unknown/copyleft for embedding
- Integration fit: TS/JS-native or API-first service boundary
- Maintenance signal: activity, community, release cadence
- Value leverage: how much functionality it gives us “for free”
- Thin-slice feasibility: can we prove value in 1 day / 1 week?
