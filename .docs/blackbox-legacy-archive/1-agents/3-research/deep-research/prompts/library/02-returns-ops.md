# Deep Research Prompt 02 — Returns & exchanges deep dive (build the Returns Ops module)

## CONTEXT

Use the shared Deep Research Context Pack (copy/paste into your run as needed):
- `context-pack.md`

## PROMPT

TASK:
Research the returns/exchanges ecosystem for Shopify beauty DTC and produce a build plan for a Returns Ops module that can outperform best-in-class tools.

1) Identify top returns platforms/tools (Shopify-first + broader) used by DTC brands.
2) Extract their feature sets into categories:
   - Return portal UX
   - Exchange flows (variant swap, upsell during exchange)
   - Store credit rules
   - Fraud/abuse prevention
   - Warehouse receiving workflows
   - Notifications (email/SMS) and support deflection
   - Reporting & analytics (return drivers, cost of returns)
3) Document pricing models and operational tradeoffs.
4) Produce a “Returns Ops” spec:
   - MVP (ship in 2–4 weeks)
   - V1 (ship in 1–2 months)
   - V2 “best in class” (3–6 months)
   Include which pieces should be workflows vs UI vs data models.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Table of competitors/features with citations.
- A final “implementation checklist” that maps directly to the module packaging (workflows + admin pages + DB tables).
