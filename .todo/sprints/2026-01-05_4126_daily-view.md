# Sprint: 2026-01-05 — “4126” Daily View Feedback

Source:
- `docs/knowledge/feedback/4-1-26/Daily View Feedback.md`
- `docs/knowledge/feedback/4-1-26/4126.todo.md`

Blackbox tracking:
- `.blackbox/state/groups.md`
- `.blackbox/state/queue.md`

## Sprint goal

Turn the raw 4-1-26 feedback into:
1) crisp, verifiable issue plans and
2) an executable implementation order (lowest-risk → highest leverage).

## Agent work split

### 01 — Research + grouping (done)

- [x] Normalize feedback into `.blackbox/inbox/issues.md`
- [x] Create issue folders under `.blackbox/issues/`
