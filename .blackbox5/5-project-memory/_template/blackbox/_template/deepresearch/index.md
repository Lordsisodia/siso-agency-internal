# Deep Research Index

This is the quick “what do we already know?” index for reusable research notes.

Guidelines:
- Prefer linking to `.blackbox/deepresearch/*.md` as the canonical summary.
- Link to the underlying run artifacts in `.blackbox/agents/.plans/` from inside each note.

## Notes
- Add new entries as you create new evergreen deepresearch notes.
