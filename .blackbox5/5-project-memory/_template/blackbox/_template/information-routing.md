# Information Routing (canonical location)

Canonical routing rules live here:
- `docs/08-meta/repo/information-routing.md`

This file is kept as a lightweight pointer to avoid breaking older links.

Note:
- Do not edit routing rules here.
- Update `docs/08-meta/repo/information-routing.md` instead.
