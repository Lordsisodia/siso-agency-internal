## What is this?

This backlog contains actionable improvements identified by Ralph's continuous autonomous analysis of Vibe Kanban. Ralph runs every 10 minutes, analyzing the codebase using first-principles to identify architectural improvements, integration issues, performance optimizations, and documentation gaps.

## How it works

1. **Ralph analyzes** Vibe Kanban autonomously every 10 minutes
2. **Identifies issues** using first-principles analysis (architecture, integration, performance, etc.)
3. **Prioritizes findings** (P1=critical, P2=high, P3=medium, P4=low)
4. **Updates this backlog** with new findings on each run

## Current Status

- **Total Issues Identified:** 4
- **P1 (Critical):** 2
- **P2 (High):** 1
- **P3 (Medium):** 1
- **P4 (Low):** 0

## Next Steps

- Review items below and add to GitHub issues if needed
- Check `.blackbox5/engine/runtime/ralph/vibe-continuous/` for full analysis
- Ralph will update this backlog as it finds new issues
