## First Principles Analysis

### The Problem

<problem>
**What problem are we trying to solve?**
- [Describe the problem clearly]
- [Who has this problem?]
- [What happens if we don't solve it?]
- [Why solve this now?]
</problem>

### Fundamental Truths

<truths>
**What do we know to be TRUE?**
1. [Truth 1 - observable, verifiable fact]
2. [Truth 2 - observable, verifiable fact]
3. [Truth 3 - observable, verifiable fact]

**What are our ASSUMPTIONS?**
1. [Assumption 1] - Verified? ✅/❌ - [How to verify?]
2. [Assumption 2] - Verified? ✅/❌ - [How to verify?]
3. [Assumption 3] - Verified? ✅/❌ - [How to verify?]

**What are CONSTRAINTS?**
- **Real Constraints** (laws of physics, time, resources):
  - [Constraint 1]
  - [Constraint 2]

- **Imagined Constraints** (can be challenged):
  - [Constraint 1] - Is this real or self-imposed?
  - [Constraint 2] - Is this real or self-imposed?
</truths>

### Solution from First Principles

<solution>
**Build from ground up (not by analogy)**

Based on fundamental truths, what's the minimal solution?
- [Core solution element 1]
- [Core solution element 2]
- [Core solution element 3]

What can we learn from existing solutions (without copying)?
- [Insight from existing approach 1]
- [Insight from existing approach 2]

What should we NOT do (what others do wrong)?
- [Common mistake 1]
- [Common mistake 2]
</solution>
