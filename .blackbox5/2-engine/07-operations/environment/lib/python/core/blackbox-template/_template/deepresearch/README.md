# Deep Research (Evergreen Notes)

This folder stores **reusable research outputs** that are likely to remain useful across future work.

Good candidates:
- Framework comparisons
- Competitor feature maps
- “How we decided X” write-ups

Naming suggestion:
- `YYYY-MM-DD_<short-topic>.md`

Index:
- Keep `index.md` updated with links to the most important evergreen notes.

Traceability:
- Each evergreen note should link back to the originating run folder in `.blackbox/agents/.plans/<run>/`.
