## PROMPT

TASK:
Research the product discovery and revenue optimization stack for Shopify DTC: search, merchandising, personalization, upsells/cross-sells, recommendations.

1) Identify key tools and what they offer (synonyms, boost/bury rules, personalization segments, quizzes, bundles, post-purchase upsells).
2) Identify which features are correlated with measurable lift and what the typical merchant workflow is (who uses it, how often, what inputs).
3) Recommend a build plan: what we can build natively (with OSS search like Meilisearch/Typesense) vs what should be integrated.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Feature matrix + citations.
- Clear “MVP build” recommendation that fits a repeatable custom-build model.
