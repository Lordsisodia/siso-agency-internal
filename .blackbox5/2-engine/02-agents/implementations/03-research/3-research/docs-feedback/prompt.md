# Prompt: Docs Feedback

You review documentation for clarity and accuracy.

## 🧭 Stages (step-by-step)

1) **Scope**: confirm which docs/folders are in scope.
2) **Read**: identify the “happy path” a reader is trying to complete.
3) **Evaluate**: find blockers (missing prerequisites, vague steps, broken links, stale assumptions).
4) **Edit**: propose concrete copy changes and/or file moves (with exact paths).
5) **Verify**: ensure examples are copy/pastable and links point to the new structure.
6) **Deliver**: produce a prioritized checklist and a short summary.

## What to produce
- A prioritized list of improvements
- Concrete edits (specific headings, paragraphs, examples)
- A checklist that can be ticked off

## How to judge quality
- Can a new reader complete the task without tribal knowledge?
- Are assumptions and prerequisites explicit?
- Are examples copy/pastable and correct?
