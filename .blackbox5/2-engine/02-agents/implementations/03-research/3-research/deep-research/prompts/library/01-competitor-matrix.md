## PROMPT

You are running a competitive teardown for a Shopify-connected ecommerce ops platform delivered as repeatable custom builds (95% reusable) transitioning into SaaS. The current client is beauty DTC (~10k orders/month).

TASK:
1) Identify the top 30 competitors relevant to “Shopify + ops layer + workflows + admin” for beauty DTC. Include: direct platforms, Shopify apps that replace modules, and ops tools (returns, CX, retention, analytics).
2) Build a feature matrix (Markdown table) with rows = competitor, columns = the most decision-driving features grouped into:
   - Returns/Exchanges
   - Support/CX
   - Subscriptions/Bundles
   - Automation/Workflows (triggers, approvals, audit logs, retries, replay)
   - Analytics/Attribution/Profit
   - Catalog Ops (bulk editing, QA, enrichment)
   - Search/Personalization/Upsells
3) For each competitor, include: target customer, pricing model (high-level), Shopify-first vs platform-agnostic, and “what they’re best at”.
4) Synthesize: “What buyers expect as table stakes” vs “where we can win” for a beauty DTC merchant.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Provide citations/links for every competitor claim and pricing/feature statement.
- End with a ranked “Top 10 differentiators to build” with reasoning and dependencies.
