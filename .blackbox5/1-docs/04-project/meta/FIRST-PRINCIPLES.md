SISO Internal is a comprehensive life management and productivity system designed to help users manage their daily lives, tasks, projects, and goals through an integrated digital experience.

## Core Purpose

**To help users manage their lives through organized domains**

SISO exists to solve the fundamental problem of life fragmentation: tasks, projects, health, finances, and goals are scattered across multiple tools and contexts. SISO brings everything together in one cohesive system.

## Who SISO Serves

## What Problems SISO Solves

### 1. Fragmented Management
**Problem**: Tasks, projects, health, and finances are scattered
**Solution**: Unified domains bring everything together

### 2. Lack of Insight
**Problem**: Users can't see patterns or progress across areas of life
**Solution**: Analytics and visualization provide insights

### 3. Motivation & Engagement
**Problem**: Sticking to habits and goals is difficult
**Solution**: Gamification through XP system and achievements

### 4. Administrative Overhead
**Problem**: Managing clients, partners, finances is time-consuming

## Key Differentiators

### Domain-Based Architecture

- **Scalable**: Easy to add new domains as needs evolve

### Integrated Gamification
- **XP Store**: Rewards and incentives drive engagement

### First Principles Design
- **User-centric**: Features start from actual user needs
- **Iterative**: Continuous improvement based on usage
- **Contextual**: Everything has a clear place and purpose

## Non-Goals

SISO is **NOT**:
- A social network (focused on individual productivity, not social features)
- An enterprise tool (designed for individuals and small businesses)
- A replacement for specialized tools (integrates with, doesn't replace)

## Success Metrics

SISO succeeds when users:
1. **Visit daily**: Daily active usage indicates habit formation
2. **Complete tasks**: High task completion rate shows utility
3. **Track progress**: Users actively monitor their metrics and XP
4. **Add domains**: Users request new domains for additional life areas

## Vision

**To be the operating system for personal productivity**

SISO aims to be the central hub where users manage their entire lives - from daily tasks to long-term goals, from health tracking to business management.
