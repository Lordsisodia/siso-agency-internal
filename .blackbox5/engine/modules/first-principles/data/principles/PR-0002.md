# PR-0002: ADI Cycle

**Status:** Active
**Category:** First Principles
**Priority:** Foundational

---

## Principle

**For complex decisions, use the Abduction → Deduction → Induction cycle.**

AI generates options (abduction), humans verify logic (deduction), both design tests (induction).

---

## Rationale

Single-shot reasoning fails for complex decisions because:
1. AI can hallucinate or make logical errors
2. Humans have cognitive biases and limited creativity
3. First-pass thinking misses edge cases
4. Decisions made without validation are often wrong

The ADI cycle ensures:
- Diverse options are generated (abduction)
- Logic is rigorously verified (deduction)
- Assumptions are tested empirically (induction)
- Decisions are validated, not just made

---

## The Three Phases

### Abduction (AI Generates Options)

**What:** Generate 3-5 hypotheses from first principles

**Who:** AI (has breadth and creativity)

**Output:**
- Conservative approach (minimal change, low risk)
- Novel approach (new architecture, balanced risk)
- Radical approach (complete rethink, high risk)
- Additional angles as needed

**Prompt:** `prompts/fp/q1_abduct.md`

**Key Questions:**
- What are the atomic variables?
- What are the hard vs soft constraints?
- What assumptions are we making?
- What are we actually optimizing for?

---

### Deduction (Human Verifies Logic)

**What:** Check each hypothesis for logical consistency

**Who:** Human (can catch AI errors and hidden assumptions)

**Output:**
- Each hypothesis marked PASS or REJECT
- Hidden assumptions identified
- Logic errors documented
- Realism check performed

**Prompt:** `prompts/fp/q2_deduct.md`

**Key Questions:**
- Is this internally consistent?
- What's being taken for granted?
- Does this violate hard constraints?
- Are timeline/cost estimates realistic?
- Is there any hallucination?

**Critical Principle:** A system cannot objectively evaluate its own outputs.

---

### Induction (Both Design Tests)

**What:** Design validation experiments for surviving hypotheses

**Who:** AI designs tests, human reviews and approves

**Output:**
- Validation plan for each hypothesis
- Falsifiable tests with success criteria
- Review schedule
- Decision matrix

**Prompt:** `prompts/fp/q3_induct.md`

**Key Questions:**
- What would prove this hypothesis wrong?
- How do we validate the critical assumptions?
- What are the go/no-go criteria?
- When do we review this decision?

---

## When to Use ADI

Use the full ADI cycle for:
- **Complex decisions** (30 min - 2 hours, high risk)
- **Critical decisions** (> 2 hours, very high risk)
- Architectural decisions
- Technology choices with significant impact
- Make vs buy decisions over $10k
- Decisions that would be expensive to reverse

**Do NOT use ADI for:**
- Simple decisions (< 5 min, low risk)
- Routine operational decisions
- Emergency decisions (no time)
- Reversible decisions with low cost

## Example: Choosing a Frontend Framework

### Q1: Abduction (AI Generates Options)

**Problem:** Choose frontend framework for new dashboard

**Hypothesis 1: React (Conservative)**
- Proven, mature ecosystem
- Largest talent pool
- Extensive library support
- Virtual DOM performance

**Hypothesis 2: Vue.js (Novel)**
- Simpler learning curve
- Better DX than React
- Smaller bundle size
- Growing ecosystem

**Hypothesis 3: Svelte (Radical)**
- Compile-time framework (no virtual DOM)
- Best performance
- Smallest bundle size
- Newer, less proven

---

### Q2: Deduction (Human Verifies Logic)

**React: ✅ PASS**
- Logically consistent
- Timeline realistic (team knows React)
- No hidden issues
- Meets all constraints

**Vue.js: ✅ PASS**
- Logically consistent
- Timeline realistic (easy to learn)
- Hidden assumption: TypeScript support is good (verified true)
- Meets all constraints

**Svelte: ❌ REJECT**
- Violates hard constraint: "Must have proven enterprise support"
- Timeline unrealistic (team would need to learn)
- Risk: Small talent pool for hiring

---

### Q3: Induction (Design Tests)

**Test 1: React POC**
- Build sample dashboard with React
- Measure performance
- Validate DX
- Success: Acceptable performance, familiar DX
- Time: 3 days

**Test 2: Vue.js POC**
- Build same dashboard with Vue
- Measure performance
- Validate DX
- Success: Better DX than React, acceptable performance
- Time: 3 days

**Decision Matrix:**
| Criterion | Weight | React | Vue.js |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Ecosystem | 30% | 5 | 4 |
| DX | 25% | 4 | 5 |
| Performance | 20% | 4 | 4 |
| Talent Pool | 25% | 5 | 3 |
| **TOTAL** | 100% | **4.5** | **4.0** |

**Winner:** React (4.5 vs 4.0)

**Rationale:** While Vue.js has better DX, React's ecosystem and talent pool advantages outweigh this for our enterprise use case.

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Don't:
- Skip abduction (only consider one option)
- Skip deduction (accept AI output without verification)
- Skip induction (decide without testing)
- Rush through phases (ADI takes time, but prevents costly mistakes)
- Use ADI for trivial decisions (overkill)

### ✅ Do:
- Generate truly diverse hypotheses (not variations of the same idea)
- Be ruthless in deduction (reject flawed hypotheses)
- Design falsifiable tests (what would prove this wrong?)
- Schedule review dates (decisions must be validated)
- Document everything (create Decision Record)

---

## Output: Decision Record

After completing ADI, create a Decision Record:

```
data/decisions/records/DEC-YYYY-###-slug.md
```

Template: See `.docs/first-principles/README.md`

## Related Principles

- **PR-0001:** Cost Decomposition - Use in abduction phase for cost analysis
- **PR-0003:** Transformer Mandate - AI generates, human decides
