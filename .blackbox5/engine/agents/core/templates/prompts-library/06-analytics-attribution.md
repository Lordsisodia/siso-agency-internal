## PROMPT

TASK:
Research ecommerce analytics platforms relevant to Shopify DTC (beauty).

1) Identify analytics/attribution/profit tools (especially those used by DTC brands).
2) Extract: what metrics they provide, how they attribute, what integrations they rely on (Meta/Google/TikTok/email/SMS), and the UX patterns merchants love.
3) Produce an “Analytics Ops” spec for our platform that’s realistic given Shopify + Supabase:
   - tables/events we should store
   - dashboards to build (executive, ops, marketing, retention, returns economics)
   - anomaly detection ideas
   - minimum viable attribution approach and caveats

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Competitor comparison + citations.
- A prioritized dashboard backlog (MVP → V1).
