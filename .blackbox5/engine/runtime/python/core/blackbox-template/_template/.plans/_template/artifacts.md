# Artifacts (created/updated)

- `<path>` — <what this file contains>

Suggested minimum:
- `artifacts/run-meta.yaml` — reproducibility metadata (inputs, model, outputs)
- `artifacts/sources.md` — URLs/paths + what each source supports
- `artifacts/summary.md` — short synthesis for humans
- `artifacts/extracted.json` — structured extraction (optional, but preferred)
- `artifacts/raw.md` — full raw output (optional; may be gitignored)
