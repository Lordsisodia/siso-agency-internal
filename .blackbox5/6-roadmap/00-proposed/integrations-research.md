# Proposal: Integrations Research

## Problem Statement
BlackBox5 has 14 MCP integrations but:
- Many high-value integrations missing
- Limited integration reliability
- No error handling patterns
- No rate limiting

## Current State
- 14 verified MCP integrations
- Basic error handling

## Proposed Solution
- High-value integrations (based on usage)
- Integration reliability improvements
- Error handling and retry logic
- Rate limiting and quota management

## Expected Impact
- Access to more external tools
- More reliable integrations
- Better error handling

## Next Steps
Approve and move to research phase. Identify high-value integrations.
