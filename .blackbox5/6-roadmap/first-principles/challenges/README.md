# Assumption Challenges

**Purpose:** Generated challenging questions that test base assumptions

---

## Overview

This directory contains challenges generated by the Assumption Challenger Agent. Each feature from `../features/` has a corresponding challenge document here.

---

## Process

1. **Feature Document Created** in `../features/{feature-name}.md`
2. **Challenger Agent Runs** and generates challenges
3. **Challenge Document Saved** as `./{feature-name}-challenges.md`
4. **Validation Designed** based on challenges
5. **Validation Run** (see `../validations/`)

---

## File Naming

`{feature-name}-challenges.md`

Examples:
- `task-analyzer-challenges.md`
- `bmad-framework-challenges.md`
- `memory-system-challenges.md`

---

## Template

Each challenge document follows this structure:

```markdown
# Challenges: [Feature Name]

**Generated:** 2026-01-19
**Feature:** [Link to feature doc]
**Total Assumptions:** X
**Total Questions:** Y

---

## Assumption 1: [Name]

**What we believe:** [Statement]
**Confidence:** [high/medium/low]
**Impact if wrong:** [What breaks]

### Questions

### Validation Experiment
[How to test this assumption]

---

## Assumption 2: [Name]
[Same structure]

---

## Priority

Validate in this order:
1. [Assumption X] - High impact, high uncertainty
2. [Assumption Y] - Medium impact, easy to validate
3. [Assumption Z] - Low impact, hard to validate
```
