    validation_result: "VALIDATED - Power law distribution confirmed by industry research, theoretical analysis supports logarithmic scaling"

    conclusion: "Assumption validated. Logarithmic scaling is appropriate for task complexity distribution. Industry research confirms power law distributions in software (file sizes, commits, bug fixing). Log scoring provides better discrimination than linear."
    action_required: "None - continue using log₁₀ scoring"
