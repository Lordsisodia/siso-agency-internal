## Key Findings

### 1. Three Dominant Architectural Patterns

#### A. Hierarchical Orchestration (AgentOrchestra Pattern)
- **Structure:** Central planning agent + specialized sub-agents
- **Pros:** Clear coordination, explicit task decomposition, extensible
- **Cons:** Single point of failure, orchestrator bottleneck
- **Best For:** Complex, multi-step workflows requiring coordination
- **Example Implementations:** AgentOrchestra, Anthropic's research system

#### B. Graph-Based Orchestration (LangGraph Pattern)
- **Structure:** Agents as nodes, interactions as edges in a DAG
- **Pros:** Flexible, supports branching/cycles, state management
- **Cons:** More complex setup, harder to debug
- **Best For:** Complex, non-linear workflows with adaptive routing
- **Example Implementations:** LangGraph, AWS graph frameworks

#### C. Conversational/Team-Based (CrewAI/AutoGen Pattern)
- **Structure:** Agents collaborate through conversation
- **Pros:** Natural interaction, easy to understand, rapid prototyping
- **Cons:** Less structured, can be inefficient for simple tasks
- **Best For:** Collaborative problem-solving, rapid iteration
- **Example Implementations:** CrewAI, AutoGen

### 2. Agent Specialization Strategies

- **Implementation:** Domain registry mapping domains to agent IDs
- **Example:** Arq AI's "routing determined by optimal domain expertise"
- **BlackBox5 Alignment:** ✓ Already implemented in TaskRouter

3. **Design for Failure:** Implement circuit breakers, timeouts, and fallback mechanisms
4. **Observable by Default:** Comprehensive logging, tracing, and metrics

#### B. Agent Design
1. **Specialized Over General:** Build focused agents rather than "super agents"
2. **Clear Contracts:** Well-defined interfaces and capabilities
3. **Stateless Where Possible:** Minimize agent-specific state
4. **Tool Abstraction:** Use tool abstractions (MCP, Function Calling)

#### C. Routing
1. **Multi-Factor Routing:** Combine complexity, domain, intent, and capacity
2. **Learning Systems:** Use feedback to improve routing decisions
3. **Graceful Degradation:** Fallback to generalist when specialist unavailable
4. **Circuit Breakers:** Prevent cascading failures

#### D. Orchestration
1. **Explicit Coordination:** Clear communication protocols between agents
2. **Adaptive Workflows:** Dynamic task allocation based on feedback
