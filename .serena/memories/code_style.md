Code is written in strict TypeScript using React function components with hooks. Styling relies on Tailwind utility classes and shadcn/Radix UI primitives. The team favors modular feature folders (e.g., src/ecosystem/internal/lifelock/...), splitting large hooks into focused composables, and mobile-first responsive layouts. Tests use Vitest/Testing Library and Playwright for E2E. Comments are sparse and kept for complex flows; avoid introducing `any` types or bespoke hook patterns outside existing directories.
