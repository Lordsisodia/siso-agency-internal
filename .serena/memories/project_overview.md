SISO-INTERNAL is a React + TypeScript + Vite progressive web app that powers SISOs internal LifeLock daily productivity and wellness experience. The frontend pairs Tailwind-based UI with Radix/Lucide components, while authentication flows through Clerk and data persists in Supabase (with offline fallbacks via IndexedDB/Tauri). The repo also includes Vercel serverless API routes and Supabase migrations for back-end features, plus a Tauri wrapper for desktop builds.
