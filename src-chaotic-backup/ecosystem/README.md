# 🌐 Ecosystem - Business Domain Structure

**The organized heart of SISO-INTERNAL business logic**

## 📊 **Overview**

The ecosystem directory contains all business domain modules organized by audience and functionality. This creates clean separation of concerns and scalable architecture.

## 🏗️ **Structure**

```
ecosystem/
├── internal/       # Internal business tools & dashboards (30+ domains)
├── partnership/    # Partner program features (future expansion)
└── client/         # Client portal features (future expansion)
```

## 🧭 **Navigation Patterns**

### **Finding Business Logic**
```typescript
// Internal team feature
src/ecosystem/internal/[domain]/

// Partner-related feature
src/ecosystem/partnership/[feature]/

// Client-facing feature  
src/ecosystem/client/[feature]/
```

### **Route Mapping**
```typescript
// Routes in App.tsx follow ecosystem structure:
/admin/life-lock     → ecosystem/internal/lifelock/
/admin/tasks         → ecosystem/internal/tasks/
/partnerships/*      → ecosystem/partnership/
/client/*           → ecosystem/client/
```

## 🔧 **Development Guidelines**

### **Adding New Domains**
1. **Determine Audience**: internal/partnership/client
2. **Create Domain Folder**: `ecosystem/[audience]/[domain]/`
3. **Follow Patterns**: Look at existing domains for structure
4. **Add Routes**: Update `App.tsx` with appropriate routes

### **Component Organization**
```typescript
ecosystem/internal/[domain]/
├── components/         # Domain-specific components
├── hooks/             # Domain-specific hooks
├── utils/             # Domain utility functions
├── types/             # Domain TypeScript types
└── [DomainName].tsx   # Main domain component
```

### **Cross-Domain Integration**
- **Shared utilities**: Use `src/shared/`
- **Cross-domain data**: Use `src/api/`
- **Common types**: Use `src/types/`
- **UI components**: Use `src/shared/ui/`

---

## 📈 **Current Status**

### **✅ Active Domains**
- **lifelock**: Main dashboard operational (AdminLifeLock.tsx)
- **tasks**: Task management system working
- **admin**: Administrative tools functional
- **dashboard**: Analytics dashboards operational

### **🚧 Development Domains**
- **claudia**: AI integration in progress
- **projects**: Project management being enhanced
- **analytics**: Business reporting being expanded

### **🔮 Future Domains**
- **partnership**: Partner program features planned
- **client**: Client portal infrastructure planned

---

## 🎯 **Architecture Benefits**

### **Scalable Organization**
- **Clear boundaries** between business domains
- **Audience-based separation** (internal/partnership/client)
- **Domain-driven design** principles

### **Development Efficiency** 
- **Easy navigation** - find business logic by domain
- **Reduced conflicts** - teams work in separate domains
- **Clear ownership** - domain experts manage their areas

### **Future-Proof Structure**
- **Partnership expansion** ready
- **Client portal** ready for development
- **New domains** easily added

*🎯 **Key Insight:** Think domains, not features. Each ecosystem folder represents a complete business domain with its own components, logic, and responsibilities.*
