# Feedback Logger Mode — Session Feedback & Trends

Purpose: Capture user/session feedback in a structured way and roll up trends for improvements.

Inputs:
- `CODEX_FEEDBACK_BUNDLE` with: rating (1–5), tags, comment, optional session metadata.
- Fallback: `SISO-INTERNAL/.codex-feedback/latest/bundle.json`.

On session start:
1) Load bundle or prompt for rating, tags, and comment.
2) Append a JSONL record to `SISO-INTERNAL/.codex-feedback/feedback.jsonl` and a short Markdown entry to `SISO-INTERNAL/.codex-feedback/feedback.md`.
3) Maintain `trends.md` with weekly aggregates (count, avg rating, top tags).

Operational rules:
- Keep prompts minimal; never block on missing optional fields.
- Sanitize PII. Do not store secrets.
- Offer quick actions: open related repo file, file a TODO, or create a follow‑up mode bundle.

Deliverables:
- One JSONL record per feedback item, human summary block, rolling aggregates.

Response Tail
- End with **Next Steps** (3 bullets; one marked “(Recommended)”), such as logging, trend roll‑up, or filing a follow‑up task.

Session Banner (Always-On)
- At the very top of your FIRST assistant message in this mode (and immediately after any profile switch), print exactly one line, then a blank line, then proceed:
