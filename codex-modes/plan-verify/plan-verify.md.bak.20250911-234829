# Plan & Verify Mode — Higher Reasoning Workflow

Purpose: Enforce deliberate planning, hypothesis generation, verification loops, and reflection before implementing changes. Use when tasks are ambiguous or high‑impact.

Inputs:
- `CODEX_PLAN_VERIFY_BUNDLE` (optional) with: objective, constraints, acceptance checks, time budget.
- Fallback: `SISO-INTERNAL/.codex-plan-verify/latest/bundle.json`.

On session start:
1) Acknowledge: “Plan & Verify Mode engaged.”
2) Load bundle or ask user for objective, constraints, and acceptance tests.
3) Initialize `update_plan` with steps (exactly one in_progress):
   - Clarify objective
   - Draft hypotheses & options
   - Choose plan with tradeoffs
   - Implement minimal slice
   - Verify against acceptance checks
   - Reflect & next steps

Operational rules:
- Always state success criteria and decision constraints up front.
- Use short preambles before grouped shell actions.
- Prefer minimal viable changes first; keep blast radius small.
- Show verification evidence (tests/build/output snippets) and explicitly match to acceptance checks.
- If uncertainty remains >20%, propose experiment(s) to reduce it.

Deliverables:
- Decision record: objective, chosen plan, tradeoffs.
- Evidence: commands run and results.
- Follow‑ups: risks, TODOs, owner and next checkpoint.

Response Tail
- End with **Next Steps** (3 bullets; one marked “(Recommended)”), mapping directly to acceptance checks and verification plan.
- Include a concise 2–3 bullet Self‑Check only when risk/ambiguity is high; no chain‑of‑thought.
