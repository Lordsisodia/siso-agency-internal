# SISO Internal Architectural Simplification PRD

*Powered by BMAD™ Core v2.0 | Brownfield Enhancement PRD*

## Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Existing Project Overview

**Analysis Source**: IDE-based fresh analysis with comprehensive architectural review

**Current Project State**: 
SISO Internal is a React-based PWA for personal productivity management featuring LifeLock daily workflows, AdminLifeLock overview, task management, and deep/light work planning. The application currently suffers from "Future Feature Factory" syndrome with 32+ directories, 100+ dependencies, 7 duplicate TaskCard components, and authentication re-render performance issues.

### Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**: ☑️ Performance/Scalability Improvements + Technology Stack Cleanup

**Enhancement Description**: 
Implement "Selective Architectural Collapse" strategy to reduce maintenance complexity by 60-70% while preserving all functionality and extensibility for planned features. Consolidate over-abstractions while maintaining architectural foundations.

**Impact Assessment**: ☑️ Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes)

### Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:
- Reduce maintenance burden by 60-70% through architectural consolidation
- Maintain 100% current functionality and user experience
- Preserve genuine extensibility points for planned features
- Improve developer experience and reduce cognitive load
- Optimize bundle size and application performance
- Establish sustainable patterns for future development

**Background Context**:
The current architecture emerged from good architectural instincts (PWA for mobile, Radix UI for scaling, TypeScript for safety) but was over-applied prematurely. This created a "Future Feature Factory" problem where complexity exists for imaginary users rather than current needs. The solution is surgical consolidation that preserves the smart foundational decisions while eliminating premature abstractions.

- **NFR3**: Development build time must improve through simplified directory structure
- **NFR4**: TypeScript strict mode compliance must be maintained
- **NFR5**: All existing performance characteristics must be preserved or improved
- **NFR6**: Code maintainability must improve through reduced duplication

- **CR2**: Database operations and service patterns must be preserved
- **CR3**: UI/UX consistency must be maintained through Radix UI + Tailwind patterns
- **CR4**: PWA manifest and service worker functionality must remain intact

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack
**Languages**: TypeScript (strict mode), JavaScript (ES modules)
**Frameworks**: React 18.3.1, Vite 5.4.1, React Router 6.26.2
**UI Library**: Radix UI (comprehensive component set), Tailwind CSS 3.4.11
**State Management**: Zustand 5.0.8, React Query (@tanstack/react-query 5.56.2)
**Authentication**: Clerk React 5.43.1
**Database**: Supabase (@supabase/supabase-js 2.49.4)
**Build/Dev**: Vite with PWA plugin, ESLint, TypeScript

### Integration Approach
**Database Integration Strategy**: Preserve all Supabase operations, consolidate duplicate service patterns
**API Integration Strategy**: Maintain existing Clerk auth and external API patterns, optimize context usage
**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Consolidate duplicate components using composition patterns, maintain Radix UI foundation
**Testing Integration Strategy**: Preserve existing Vitest + Playwright setup, add regression tests for consolidation

### Code Organization and Standards
**File Structure Approach**: Consolidate 32 directories to 8-10 focused domains (ecosystem, components, services, shared utilities)
**Naming Conventions**: Maintain existing React + TypeScript conventions
**Coding Standards**: Preserve TypeScript strict mode, ESLint rules, existing component patterns
**Documentation Standards**: Maintain existing inline documentation, improve architectural clarity

### Deployment and Operations
**Build Process Integration**: Maintain Vite build pipeline, optimize for reduced bundle size
**Deployment Strategy**: No changes to deployment process, maintain PWA capabilities
**Monitoring and Logging**: Preserve existing error boundaries and monitoring
**Configuration Management**: Maintain environment variable patterns

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation
**Technical Risks**: 
- Component consolidation could introduce regressions
- Service layer changes could break integrations
- Directory restructuring could break imports

**Integration Risks**:
- Authentication optimization could affect user sessions
- PWA functionality could be inadvertently broken
- State management changes could cause data loss

**Deployment Risks**: 
- Build process changes could affect production deployments
- Bundle optimization could cause runtime errors

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Incremental consolidation with rollback points at each step
- Comprehensive regression testing after each phase
- Git branching strategy with ability to revert changes
- User acceptance testing before each deployment

## Epic and Story Structure

### Epic Approach
**Epic Structure Decision**: Single comprehensive epic with sequential phases to minimize risk to existing system. Brownfield approach favors incremental consolidation over big-bang changes.
