# BMAD Story 1.4: Emergency Directory Restructure

## 🚨 Status: DEFCON 1 EMERGENCY
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Development impossible with current structure  
**Story Status**: In Progress  
**Assigned**: Emergency Architecture Team  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days  
**Risk Level**: HIGH (Major refactor, many imports to update)

---

## 🎯 Business (WHY)

### The Problem: Development Hell
- **742 total directories** in project (304 in src alone)
- **35 top-level directories** in src/ - completely unmaintainable
- **AI gets confused** trying to navigate structure
- **Developers get lost** - "Where is TaskCard?" takes 5+ minutes
- **File discovery impossible** - features scattered everywhere
- **Onboarding nightmare** - new devs lost for days

### Business Impact
- **Development velocity**: Down 70% due to navigation overhead
- **Bug introduction**: High - developers edit wrong files
- **AI assistance**: Broken - patterns unrecognizable  
- **Team scalability**: Impossible - too complex to explain
- **Technical debt**: Exponential growth from scattered duplicates

### Success Metrics
- **File discovery**: 5 minutes → 5 seconds
- **AI confidence**: 20% → 90% correct file suggestions
- **Onboarding**: 3 days → 30 minutes to understand structure
- **Development speed**: 3x faster with predictable locations

## 📋 Massive PRD (WHAT)

### Current Disaster Analysis

#### 🚨 Junk Folders (DELETE IMMEDIATELY)
```
src/refactored/          # Senior dev: "delete this junk"
src/enhanced-system/     # More junk
src/mechanics/           # More junk  
src/ai-first/           # Experimental junk
src/youtube-scraper/    # Random feature mixed with core
```

#### 🔥 Duplicate Chaos (MERGE)
```
src/test/ AND src/tests/    # Seriously, WTF?
src/types/                  # vs ecosystem/types, refactored/types
src/shared/ (37 dirs)      # "Shared directory madness"
src/services/ (65 dirs)    # Service explosion after our fixes
```

#### ⚠️ Over-Nested Structure
```
src/ecosystem/internal/tools/layout/header/  # 6 levels deep!
src/ecosystem/internal/tasks/components/ui/  # Unnecessary nesting
```

### Target Architecture: Clean 8-Directory Structure

```
src/
├── components/          # All UI components (reusable)
├── pages/              # Route components only  
├── features/           # Business logic domains
│   ├── tasks/
│   ├── calendar/
│   ├── analytics/
│   └── lifelock/
├── services/           # API calls & external integrations
├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks
├── types/              # TypeScript type definitions
├── utils/              # Pure utility functions
└── assets/             # Static files, images, styles
```

### Migration Strategy

#### Phase 1: Emergency Cleanup (Day 1)
1. **Delete junk folders** (zero imports found)
   - `src/refactored/`
   - `src/enhanced-system/`
   - `src/mechanics/`
   - `src/ai-first/`
   
2. **Merge duplicates**
   - `src/test/` + `src/tests/` → `tests/` (outside src)
   - Multiple type folders → `src/types/`

#### Phase 2: Core Restructure (Day 2) 
1. **Create /src-simple/** parallel structure
2. **Move ecosystem/internal/** to **features/**
3. **Consolidate shared/** into logical locations
4. **Flatten over-nested directories**

#### Phase 3: Import Updates (Day 3)
1. **Update all import statements** 
2. **Test all functionality**
3. **Replace src/ with src-simple/**
4. **Verify CI/CD still works**

## 🏗 Architecture (HOW)

### File Movement Plan

#### Components Consolidation
```typescript
// FROM: Scattered everywhere
src/ecosystem/internal/tasks/components/
src/shared/components/
src/components/
src/refactored/components/

// TO: Single location
src/components/
├── ui/           # Basic UI primitives  
├── forms/        # Form components
├── layout/       # Layout components
└── domain/       # Business-specific components
```

#### Features Organization  
```typescript
// FROM: Deep nesting
src/ecosystem/internal/tasks/management/
src/ecosystem/internal/tasks/ui/
src/ecosystem/internal/tasks/pages/
src/ecosystem/internal/tasks/components/

// TO: Feature-based
src/features/tasks/
├── components/   # Task-specific components
├── hooks/        # Task-specific hooks  
├── services/     # Task-specific API calls
├── types/        # Task-specific types
└── pages/        # Task route components
```

#### Services Simplification
```typescript
// FROM: Service explosion (65 directories!)
src/services/database/operations/tasks/crud/
src/services/api/endpoints/task-management/
src/services/integrations/supabase/tasks/

// TO: Clean organization  
src/services/
├── api.ts        # Unified API (already created!)
├── database.ts   # Database operations
├── auth.ts       # Authentication
└── external/     # Third-party integrations
```

### Safe Migration Process

#### 1. Backup Safety
```bash
git checkout -b emergency-directory-restructure
git add .
git commit -m "🚨 Backup before emergency directory restructure"
```

#### 2. Create Parallel Structure
```bash
mkdir src-simple
# Build clean structure in parallel
# Test imports work
# Verify functionality
```

#### 3. Atomic Replacement
```bash
mv src src-old
mv src-simple src
# Test everything
# If broken: mv src src-simple && mv src-old src
```

### Import Update Strategy

#### Automated Import Updates
```bash
# Find all files with imports from old structure
grep -r "from.*ecosystem/internal" src/
grep -r "from.*shared/" src/
grep -r "from.*refactored/" src/

# Use VS Code find/replace with regex
# Update package.json scripts if needed
```

#### Critical Files to Update
- All component imports
- API route imports  
- Hook imports
- Type imports
- Test file imports
