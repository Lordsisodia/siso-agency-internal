# Task Intelligence Implementation

## ðŸ§  Auto-TodoWrite Activation

### Triggers for Automatic Task Decomposition:
```javascript
// Pseudo-code for when to activate TodoWrite
const shouldUseTaskIntelligence = (userRequest) => {
  return (
    userRequest.includes('multiple components') ||
    userRequest.includes('architecture') ||
    userRequest.mentions('complex') ||
    userRequest.estimatedTime > '1 day' ||
    userRequest.affectsMultipleFiles > 3 ||
    userRequest.requiresPlanning ||
    userRequest.mentions('implement feature') ||
    userRequest.includes('fix multiple issues')
  );
};
```

### Smart Task Breakdown Patterns:

#### For New Features:
```
1. Analyze existing codebase patterns
2. Identify required file changes
3. Plan component hierarchy  
4. Design data flow
5. Implement core functionality
6. Add styling and responsive design
7. Test across devices
8. Update documentation
```

#### For Bug Fixes:
```
1. Reproduce the issue
2. Identify root cause
3. Plan minimal fix approach
4. Implement fix
5. Add regression tests
6. Verify fix works
```

#### For Architecture Changes:
```
1. Assess current architecture
2. Design migration strategy
3. Plan incremental changes
4. Backup critical data/code
5. Implement changes step-by-step
6. Test each step thoroughly
7. Update related documentation
```

## ðŸ“‹ TodoWrite Enhancement

### Enhanced Todo Structure:
```javascript
{
  content: "Clear, actionable task description",
  activeForm: "Present continuous form for status display", 
  status: "pending" | "in_progress" | "completed",
  priority: "high" | "medium" | "low", // NEW
  estimatedTime: "5min" | "30min" | "2hr" | "1day", // NEW
  dependencies: ["todo_id_1", "todo_id_2"], // NEW
  category: "analysis" | "implementation" | "testing" | "documentation" // NEW
}
```

### Smart Status Management:
- Only ONE task "in_progress" at a time
- Auto-complete dependent tasks
- Surface blocked tasks clearly
- Provide completion percentage

## ðŸŽ¯ Context-Aware Task Decomposition

### React Component Tasks:
```
For: "Add user profile component"
â†’ Generate:
1. Design component interface and props
2. Create basic component structure
3. Implement data fetching
4. Add form validation (if applicable)
5. Style with Tailwind + shadcn/ui
6. Make responsive for mobile
7. Add loading and error states
8. Write unit tests
9. Update parent components to use new component
```

### Database Operation Tasks:
```
For: "Add user preferences table"
â†’ Generate:
1. Design table schema
2. Create Supabase migration
3. Update TypeScript types
4. Create database service functions
5. Add RLS policies for security
6. Test CRUD operations
7. Update frontend to use new data
```

### Bug Fix Tasks:
```
For: "Fix mobile scroll issues"
â†’ Generate:
1. Analyze current scroll container structure
2. Identify competing scroll areas
3. Review mobile PWA best practices
4. Design unified scroll solution
5. Implement scroll container fix
6. Test mobile scroll behavior
7. Document solution for future reference
```

## ðŸš€ Proactive Task Intelligence

### Auto-Enhancement:
- Detect when user provides partial requirements
- Suggest additional considerations
- Flag potential edge cases
- Recommend testing strategies

### Risk Assessment:
- Identify breaking changes
- Suggest backup strategies  
- Flag complex dependencies
- Recommend incremental approaches

### Quality Gates:
- Ensure TypeScript compliance
- Verify mobile responsiveness
- Check test coverage
- Validate security considerations

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics

### Task Completion Tracking:
```
- Average time per task type
- Success rate (completed without rework)
- User satisfaction with breakdown quality
- Reduction in missed requirements
```

### Intelligence Quality:
```
- Accuracy of time estimates
- Relevance of generated tasks
- Usefulness of suggested considerations
- Reduction in scope creep
```

## ðŸ”„ Continuous Learning

### Feedback Integration:
- Track which task breakdowns work well
- Learn from user modifications to generated tasks
- Adapt patterns based on project specifics
- Improve time estimation accuracy

### Pattern Recognition:
- Identify common task sequences
- Create reusable task templates
- Build project-specific patterns
- Enhance domain knowledge
