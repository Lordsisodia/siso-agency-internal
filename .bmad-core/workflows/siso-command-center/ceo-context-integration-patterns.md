## ðŸ“‹ **Core CEO Context Principles**

### **CEO-Centric Development Philosophy**
1. **Executive Workflow Preservation**: Never disrupt existing CEO workflows during development
2. **Productivity Optimization**: Every feature must demonstrably improve CEO productivity
3. **User Experience Excellence**: CEO-grade user experience in all interactions
4. **Business Value Focus**: Clear ROI and business impact for all development efforts
5. **Strategic Alignment**: All technical decisions support strategic business objectives

### **CEO Requirements Classification**
