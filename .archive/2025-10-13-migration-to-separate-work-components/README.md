# Migration: Separate Deep Work & Light Work Components

**Date**: 2025-10-13
**Type**: Component Migration & Architecture Improvement

## What Was Changed

### Before (Single Component with Prop):
```
/components/ui/siso-deep-focus-plan.tsx
  - Single component (872 lines, 37,615 bytes)
  - taskType prop: 'deep-work' | 'light-work'
  - Conditional theming (blue vs green)
```

### After (Separate Domain Components):
```
/ecosystem/internal/lifelock/views/daily/deep-work/components/DeepWorkTaskList.tsx
  - Blue theme hardcoded
  - Deep Work specific

/ecosystem/internal/lifelock/views/daily/light-work/components/LightWorkTaskList.tsx
  - Green theme hardcoded
  - Light Work specific
```

## Why This Migration

1. **Domain Separation**: Each section now has its own dedicated component
2. **Proper Architecture**: Follows the `/views/daily/[section]/components/` pattern
3. **Maintainability**: Changes to deep work don't affect light work
4. **Type Safety**: Each component uses its specific hook (useDeepWorkTasksSupabase vs useLightWorkTasksSupabase)

## Files Archived

### Main Components:
- `siso-deep-focus-plan.tsx` - Original perfect working component
- `siso-light-work-plan.tsx` - Legacy light work variant
- `siso-deep-focus-plan-v2.tsx` - Alternate version

### Old Component Versions:
- `DeepWorkTaskList.OLD.tsx` - Previous deep work implementation
- `LightWorkTaskList.OLD.tsx` - Previous light work implementation

## Migration Details

**Preserved 100%:**
- All functionality (task expansion, editing, calendar, priority)
- All animations and transitions
- Flow State Protocol section
- SimpleFeedbackButton
- TaskDetailModal
- Exact same imports (SubtaskItem, CustomCalendar)

**Changed:**
- Removed `taskType` prop
- Removed `isLightWork` conditional variable
- Hardcoded theme colors per component
- Hardcoded hook usage per component

## Rollback Instructions

If needed, to rollback:

1. Copy `siso-deep-focus-plan.tsx` back to `/components/ui/`
2. Update `admin-lifelock-tabs.ts`:
   ```ts
   import SisoDeepFocusPlan from '@/components/ui/siso-deep-focus-plan';

   'work': { components: [SisoDeepFocusPlan], componentProps: { taskType: 'deep-work' } }
   'light-work': { components: [SisoDeepFocusPlan], componentProps: { taskType: 'light-work' } }
   ```

## Additional Improvements Made

- Fixed priority selector cutoff issue (changed from absolute to fixed positioning)
- Removed duplicate Today card from Nightly Checkout
- Removed purple progress line from Checkout section
- Added glassmorphism to bottom navigation

## Status

✅ **Migration Successful** - Both tabs rendering pixel-perfect
✅ **Zero Breaking Changes** - Exact same functionality
✅ **Performance**: Identical (same code, just reorganized)
✅ **Tested**: Deep Work (blue) and Light Work (green) both working
