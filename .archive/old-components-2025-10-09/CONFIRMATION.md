## ❌ OLD BLOATED COMPONENTS (Replaced on 2025-10-09)

### 1. DeepFocusWorkSection-OLD-421lines.tsx (17KB)
- **Lines**: 421 lines

### 2. LightFocusWorkSection-OLD-886lines.tsx (34KB) 
- **Lines**: 886 lines  
- **Issues**: Massive bloat, hardcoded mock tasks, duplicate logic
- **Replaced with**: `UnifiedWorkSection` (118 lines via v2)

### 3. NightlyCheckoutSection ✅ KEPT (454 lines)
- This one was **GOOD** - has clean "What went well" + progress bar
- We KEPT this one and just added date header

## What We Replaced Them With

- `DeepFocusWorkSection-v2.tsx` → Uses `UnifiedWorkSection` + `useDeepWorkTasksSupabase`
- `LightFocusWorkSection-v2.tsx` → Uses `UnifiedWorkSection` + `useLightWorkTasksSupabase`
- Both connect to REAL Supabase data (not mock)
