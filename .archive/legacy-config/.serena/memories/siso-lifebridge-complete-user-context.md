## Complete Feature Breakdown

### 1. Morning Routine System
**Purpose**: Structured start optimized for business performance
**Core Elements**:
- Wake time tracking
- Quick workout routine
- Supplement intake logging
- Meditation/mindfulness
- Day planning session
**Business Impact**: Sets productive foundation for CEO decision-making

### 2. Task Management System (Core Innovation)

#### Light Work Tasks
**Definition**: Tasks requiring minimal brain power but taking time
**Examples**: 
- Calling lawyer/accountant
- Booking appointments (optician, etc.)
- Administrative tasks (visa applications, etc.)
- Email management
- Quick errands

**Characteristics**:
- Can be done in background/low-energy states
- 4-5 tasks typically completed in 2-3 hours
- Prioritized by due date primarily
- Quick completion, minimal cognitive load

#### Deep Work Tasks  
**Definition**: High-cognitive tasks requiring focus and brain power
**Examples**:
- Working on SISO Internal app development
- Client calls and strategy sessions
- Business development work
- Complex problem-solving

**Characteristics**:
- Requires laptop/focused environment
- 2-3 hours might equal half of one deep work task
- User wants 80% of time spent on deep work
- Prioritized by business value and daily priorities
- High cognitive demand, strategic importance

#### Task Prioritization Logic
**Light Work**: Due date driven, shortest deadline first
**Deep Work**: Business priority driven, morning planning + daily adaptation
**User Approach**: Uses intuition + business needs, wants AI assistance not replacement

### 3. AI Assistant Integration (Game Changer Feature)

#### Morning Interaction Pattern
**Flow**: User talks to AI → AI presents available tasks → User selects focus → AI helps prioritize
**Key Principle**: AI doesn't suggest NEW tasks, only works with existing backlog
**Learning Requirement**: Must learn productivity patterns over time

#### Voice Interaction Capabilities
**Modes**: Full conversations + quick voice commands
**Visual Integration**: Real-time timebox updates while conversing
**Feedback Loop**: User can give live feedback while seeing changes
**Schedule Management**: Can read back schedule, but visual confirmation preferred

#### Intelligence Requirements
**Pattern Learning**: Track past productivity for optimization suggestions
**Context Awareness**: Understand business priorities and energy patterns
**Real-Time Adaptation**: Adjust throughout day based on interruptions/changes

### 4. Timebox System (24-Hour Visual Interface)
**Concept**: Visual 24-hour timeline with drag-and-drop task scheduling
**AI Integration**: Auto-suggestions for optimal timing based on:
- Task type (light vs deep work)
- User energy patterns
- Historical productivity data
**Interaction**: Drag-and-drop + AI conversation for live adjustments
**Flexibility**: Handle interruptions and time overruns dynamically

### 5. Wellness Tracking System
**Current Scope**: Basic health metrics for business performance
**Metrics Tracked**:
- Calorie intake and nutrition
- Water consumption
- Supplement intake
- Workout completion
- General activity levels

**Data Visualization**: Graphs and trends to correlate with productivity
**Input Methods**: Photo-based food logging + voice input + manual entry (all three options)
**Business Focus**: Health as productivity optimization, not fitness goals

### 6. Nightly Checkout System
**Purpose**: Daily reflection and next-day preparation
**Structure**:
- 3+ things that went well (wins documentation)
- Planning for tomorrow (task preparation)
- Implementation notes and brainstorming
- Priority setting for next day

**Business Value**: Continuous improvement loop for CEO effectiveness
**AI Integration**: Should inform morning planning and pattern learning

### 7. Experience Point (XP) System
**Philosophy**: Gamification to drive valuable task completion
**XP Allocation**: 
- Harder tasks = more XP
- Higher business value = more XP
- Trains focus on valuable work only

**XP Store Rewards**:
- Personal activities (going out, drinks, poker)
- Life upgrades and experiences
- Business/personal development activities
**Status**: Foundation laid, not current priority

## Technical Architecture Requirements

### Current State
- Built on React/TypeScript ecosystem
- Modular section-based architecture
- Tab-based navigation system
- Integration with Supabase for data

### AI Integration Needs
- Voice-to-voice capability
- Real-time visual updates during conversation
- Pattern learning and recommendation engine
- Context-aware task management

### Data Requirements
- Task backlog with metadata (due dates, estimates, business value)
- Historical productivity patterns
- Wellness correlation data
- XP and gamification tracking

## User Behavior Patterns

### Daily Workflow
1. **Morning**: AI conversation → task selection → day planning
2. **Throughout Day**: Execute timeboxed tasks with live AI adjustments
3. **Evening**: Nightly checkout → reflection → tomorrow preparation

### Decision Making
- **Intuitive Prioritization**: Uses business sense + AI assistance
- **Flexibility**: Adapts to business needs throughout day
