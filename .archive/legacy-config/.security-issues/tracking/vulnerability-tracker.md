2. **Package Maintenance**: `inflight` package is unmaintained
3. **Exploitation Complexity**: Requires local access and specific conditions
4. **Application Impact**: Could cause memory leaks leading to crashes

## Action Items

### Immediate (Next 30 days)
- [ ] Monitor `vite-plugin-pwa` for updates that might remove `glob` dependency
- [ ] Implement application memory monitoring
- [ ] Add rate limiting for asynchronous operations

### Medium-term (Next 90 days)
- [ ] Evaluate PWA alternatives if no upstream fix available
- [ ] Review dependency update policies
- [ ] Consider automated dependency update tools (Dependabot, Renovate)

### Long-term (Next 6 months)
- [ ] Establish security review process for new dependencies
- [ ] Create security testing in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Regular security training for development team
