# Task Manager & Life Tracker Project Plan
**Date:** July 29, 2025 - 17:08 (Tuesday)  
**Project Location:** SISO-CORE

## 🎯 Project Goals

### Primary Objective
Build a comprehensive task manager, agenda, and blog tracker system that will be essential for managing daily life activities.

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Architecture Decision**: Keep the client-facing app integrated within SISO-CORE
   - Rather than separating it into its own repository
   - Maintains cohesion with the ecosystem
   
2. **Hosting Strategy**: 
   - Self-hosted on Vercel
   - Leverages Vercel's excellent performance for task management features
   - Ensures reliable uptime for daily use

## 📋 Core Features to Implement

### 1. Task Manager
- Create, read, update, delete tasks
- Priority levels and categorization
- Due dates and reminders
- Progress tracking
- Subtasks support

### 2. Agenda/Calendar
- Daily, weekly, monthly views
- Event scheduling
- Integration with task deadlines
- Recurring events support

### 3. Blog Tracker
- Track blog post ideas
- Draft management
- Publishing schedule
- Analytics integration
- Content calendar

## 🏗️ Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript (following SISO ecosystem standards)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Supabase for data persistence
- **Hosting**: Vercel
- **State Management**: React Query + Jotai
