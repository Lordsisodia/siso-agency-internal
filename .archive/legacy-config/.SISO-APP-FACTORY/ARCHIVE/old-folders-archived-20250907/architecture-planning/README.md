# 🏗️ SISO Architecture Planning Hub

## 🎯 Mission: Deep Architecture Research & Planning

This folder contains our **100 compute hours** deep dive into architecting the perfect SISO application structure. We're taking everything we've learned and researching the best possible architecture for our complex business management platform.
