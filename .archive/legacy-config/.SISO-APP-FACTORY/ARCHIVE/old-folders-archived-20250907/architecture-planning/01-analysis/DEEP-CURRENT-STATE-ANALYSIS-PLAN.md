## ðŸš¨ ANALYSIS SAFETY RULES

1. **NO CODE CHANGES** during analysis phase
2. **BACKUP EVERYTHING** before any testing
3. **DOCUMENT EVERYTHING** you discover
4. **TEST ALL FEATURES** to understand current behavior
5. **VERIFY DATA EXPORT** works completely before proceeding

This analysis phase will give us complete confidence before any transformation begins. We'll know exactly what we're working with and have multiple safety nets in place.
