## 🚨 Current Architecture Problems

### **1. Structural Chaos (Score: 2/10)**

- **Mixed concerns everywhere** - tests, configs, business logic intermingled

### **2. AI Navigation Nightmare**
- **50+ file reads needed** to understand basic structure
- **No clear entry points** or index files
- **Inconsistent naming patterns** across codebase  
- **Multiple similar directories** causing confusion

### **3. Developer Experience Issues**
- **Slow discovery** - takes hours to understand features
- **High cognitive load** - too many choices and patterns
- **Merge conflicts** - overlapping file modifications
- **Onboarding difficulty** - new developers get lost

### **4. Scalability Concerns**
- **Monolithic structure** - hard to scale teams
- **Tight coupling** - changes ripple across system
- **No feature boundaries** - everything depends on everything
- **Bundle size issues** - single large bundle
