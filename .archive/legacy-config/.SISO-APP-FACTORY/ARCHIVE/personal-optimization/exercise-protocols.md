## Evidence-Based Physical Training for Maximum Cognitive Performance

*Based on 2024 neurogenesis, BDNF, and cognitive enhancement research*

---

## **üß† EXERCISE-BRAIN CONNECTION SCIENCE**

### **Neurobiological Mechanisms**
- **BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)**: Exercise increases BDNF by 200-300%, promoting neuroplasticity
- **Neurogenesis**: New neuron formation in hippocampus (memory center)
- **Vascular Changes**: Improved cerebral blood flow and oxygen delivery
- **Neurotransmitter Optimization**: Enhanced dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin

### **2024 Research Breakthrough**
**Key Finding**: Shorter-duration HIIT (20 minutes) is more effective than 30-minute sessions for BDNF elevation and cognitive enhancement. The 30-minute group showed higher cortisol levels, suggesting diminishing returns with excessive intensity.
