## 🎯 CURRENT FOCUS: SISO INTERNAL

### Core Internal Features:
- **LifeLock** - Daily planning & task management
- **Admin Tools** - Client management, financials, teams
- **Task Management** - Project tracking, time blocking
- **Team Coordination** - Internal workflows

### Future Expansion Ready:
- Client portal structure defined
- Partnership program structure defined
- Shared components reusable across all domains
- Supabase RLS ready for multi-tenant access

## 🔐 SUPABASE ARCHITECTURE

```sql
-- User roles and access
CREATE TYPE user_role AS ENUM ('admin', 'client', 'partner');

-- Row Level Security by role
CREATE POLICY "Role-based access" ON tasks
FOR ALL USING (
  CASE 
    WHEN current_user_role() = 'admin' THEN true
    WHEN current_user_role() = 'client' THEN client_id = auth.uid()
    WHEN current_user_role() = 'partner' THEN partner_id = auth.uid()
  END
);
```

## 🚀 IMPLEMENTATION PHASES
