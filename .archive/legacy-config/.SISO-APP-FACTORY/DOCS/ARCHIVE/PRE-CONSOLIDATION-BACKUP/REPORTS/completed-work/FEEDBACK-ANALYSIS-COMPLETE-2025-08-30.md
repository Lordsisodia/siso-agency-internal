## üîç **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS FINDINGS**

### **üö® CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Mock Database Client**
**File**: `/src/integrations/prisma/client.ts`
**Issue**: The entire Prisma client is **mocked** with console.log statements like `"[MOCK]"`
**Impact**: NO real database operations are happening - explains all persistence issues

### **üì± MOBILE TOUCH PROBLEMS**
**Evidence Found**: Multiple mobile-specific CSS and event handling issues
**Affected Components**: Light work, deep work, checkout sections
**Root Cause**: Missing touch-action CSS, inadequate touch targets

### **üîÑ STATE MANAGEMENT CHAOS**  
**Evidence Found**: 
- localStorage used in `taskPersistenceService.ts`
- Mock Prisma client in browser
- Mixed persistence strategies causing data loss

### **üß© MISSING CRUD OPERATIONS**
**Evidence Found**: Incomplete component implementations
**Impact**: No delete functionality, duplication bugs, incomplete form handling
