## 🎛️ **SUPER-ADMIN FEATURES**

const ClientImpersonator = () => (
  <div className="super-admin-controls bg-red-100 p-4 mb-4">
    <h3>👑 Super Admin: View as Client</h3>
    <select onChange={handleClientSwitch}>
      <option>Select Client to Impersonate...</option>
      <option value="acme-corp">Acme Corp Dashboard</option>
      <option value="startup-beta">Startup Beta Dashboard</option>
      <option value="enterprise-inc">Enterprise Inc Dashboard</option>
    </select>
    <button onClick={exitImpersonation}>Exit Impersonation</button>
  </div>
);
```

### **2. Cross-Tenant Analytics**
```typescript
// Shaan gets unified view across all business areas
const SuperAdminDashboard = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>SISO Empire Overview</h1>
    
    <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-6">
      <Card title="Internal Productivity">
        <TaskMetrics />
        <LifeLockStats />
      </Card>

## 🏗️ **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

### **Single Codebase Benefits:**
- **Shared Components** - UI consistency across all areas
- **Unified Database** - Cross-tenant analytics and reporting
- **Single Deployment** - One app to build, test, and maintain
- **Feature Reuse** - Internal tools become client/partner features

### **Data Isolation Strategy:**
```sql
-- Row Level Security with super-admin bypass
CREATE POLICY "tenant_isolation_with_super_admin" ON tasks
  FOR ALL USING (
    -- Super admin sees everything
    auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'super_admin'
    OR 
    -- Regular users see only their tenant data
    (tenant_type = current_setting('app.tenant_type', true)
     AND user_id = auth.uid())
  );
```

### **Auth Flow:**
```typescript
// Shaan's login flow
1. Login at www.siso.agency/internal (main workspace)
2. Role: super_admin detected
3. Navigation shows all sections
4. Can switch to any tenant context
5. Impersonate any user in any tenant
6. Audit trail logs all actions
```
