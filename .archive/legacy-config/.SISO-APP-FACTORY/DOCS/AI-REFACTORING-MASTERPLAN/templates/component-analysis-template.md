## ROI Analysis

### Effort Estimation
- **Analysis Time**: [Hours estimated]
- **Implementation Time**: [Hours estimated] 
- **Testing Time**: [Hours estimated]
- **Total Effort**: [Total hours]

### Expected Benefits
- **Lines Reduced**: [Estimated number]
- **Performance Improvement**: [Percentage estimated]
- **Maintainability Score**: [1-10 improvement]
- **Reusability Factor**: [Number of places could be reused]

### ROI Calculation
```
Time Savings = (Lines Reduced √ó 0.1 minutes) + (Bugs Prevented √ó 30 minutes)
Performance Gain = [Bundle size reduction + Render optimization]
Maintenance Savings = (Duplicate Code Elimination √ó Bug Rate) √ó Hourly Cost

Total Value = Time Savings + Performance Gain + Maintenance Savings
Investment Cost = Total Effort √ó Hourly Rate
ROI = ((Total Value - Investment Cost) / Investment Cost) √ó 100
```

**Calculated ROI**: [Percentage]%
**Payback Period**: [Months]
