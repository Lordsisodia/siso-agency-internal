## 🎉 The Ultimate Goal

**This system succeeds when you eventually don't need it anymore.**

The XP store teaches you:
- Conscious decision-making about pleasures
- Natural work-reward balance
- Identity as someone who "earns their fun"
- Sustainable productivity habits

After 6-12 months, these patterns become internalized, and you'll maintain excellent productivity and healthy indulgence naturally - with or without the XP system.
