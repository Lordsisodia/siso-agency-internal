This session revealed that most "mobile issues" were actually **data persistence problems** affecting all platforms. The mobile-specific UI issues were secondary to the core database functionality problems.

## 🚀 **Recommended Next Steps**

1. **Immediate**: Fix database mock client (resolves 50% of issues)
2. **This Week**: Address time display and date context bugs  
3. **Sprint**: Plan daily wisdom expansion enhancement
