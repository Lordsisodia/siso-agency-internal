## üîç VALIDATION CHECKLIST

To confirm these predictions, test:
- [ ] Deep Focus Work section mobile interactions
- [ ] Health tracking form on mobile  
- [ ] Voice command task persistence
- [ ] Focus session data saving
- [ ] All time displays for AM/PM accuracy
- [ ] Weekly navigation date accuracy
- [ ] Offline PWA functionality

## üìä FEEDBACK PATTERN INSIGHTS

**What the user is really testing:**
1. **End-to-end workflows** - Does the complete user journey work?
2. **Cross-platform consistency** - Same experience on mobile vs desktop?
3. **Data reliability** - Will my work/data be there when I come back?
4. **Touch-first design** - Is mobile a first-class experience?
5. **Real-world usage** - Does it work under actual usage conditions?

**User's mental model:**
- "If one similar thing is broken, others probably are too"
- "Mobile should work as well as desktop"  
- "My data should never disappear"
- "Time displays should make sense"
- "The app should work like other apps I use"
