I want to test MCP integration. Can you:

1. List what MCP tools are available to you
2. If you see any Codex-related MCP tools, use them to create a simple TypeScript function that adds two numbers
3. Show me the exact tool names and capabilities you have access to

This is a test to verify MCP integration is working correctly.
