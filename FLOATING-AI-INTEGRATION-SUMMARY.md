## üé® **Smart Context Awareness**

The AI assistant adapts its initial message based on:

- **Notifications** (shows badge for contextual suggestions)

Example messages:
- **Morning (6-10am)**: "Good morning! Ready to start your 23-minute morning routine?"
- **Work hours (9-5pm)**: "Hi there! I can help you organize tasks, plan routines, or process your thoughts."
- **Evening (5-8pm)**: "Time to reflect on your day!"
