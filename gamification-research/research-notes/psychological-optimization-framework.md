## ðŸŽ® Phase-Based Optimization Strategy

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)**
**Goal**: Install core psychological patterns without overwhelming

```typescript
const phase1Implementation = {
  psychologicalFocus: "Habit formation and loss aversion installation",
  
  activeFeatures: [
    "Basic XP earning from tasks",
    "Simple spending confirmation dialogs", 
    "Visible XP balance always shown",
    "Basic reward categories (cannabis, time off, food)"
  ],
  
  psychologicalTechniques: {
    lossAversion: {
      implementation: "Confirmation dialog showing remaining XP",
      intensity: "Mild - just awareness building"
    },
    
    endowmentEffect: {
      implementation: "Detailed XP earning history",
      purpose: "Make XP feel 'owned' and valuable"
    },
    
    mentalAccounting: {
      implementation: "Separate XP earnings from regular money",
      effect: "Create distinct 'earned pleasure' category"
    }
  },
  
  monitoring: [
    "Track spending decision times (should increase)",
    "Monitor reward satisfaction ratings",
    "Measure productivity consistency"
  ],
  
  successCriteria: [
